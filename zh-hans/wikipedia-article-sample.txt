Its total land area is {{convert|76.8|sqmi|km2}}?slightly larger than [[Washington, D.C.]]?consisting of five rugged, volcanic islands and two [[coral atoll]]s. The five volcanic islands are: [[Tutuila]], [[Aunu\'u]], [[Ofu-Olosega|Ofu]], [[Ofu-Olosega|Olosega]], [[Tau, American Samoa|Tau]]. The coral atolls are: [[Swains Island|Swains]], and [[Rose Atoll]]. Of the seven islands, Rose Atoll is an uninhabited Marine National Monument.\n\nDue to its positioning in the South Pacific Ocean, it is frequently hit by typhoons between December and March. Rose Atoll is the easternmost point of the territory. American Samoa is the southernmost part of the United States. American Samoa is home to the [[National Park of American Samoa]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Samoan Islands]]\n*[[Geography of Samoa]]\n*[[Swamps of American Samoa]]\n*{{wikiatlas|American Samoa}}\n\n{{American Samoa}}\n{{U.S. political divisions geographies}}\n{{Geography of Oceania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of American Samoa}}\n[[Category:Geography of American Samoa| ]]\n\n\n{{AmericanSamoa-geo-stub}}'

'Politics_of_American_Samoa'	'{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{unreferenced|date=February 2011}}\n{{Politics of American Samoa}}\n\'\'\'Politics of American Samoa\'\'\' takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[List of American Samoa Governors|Governor]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[Wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. [[American Samoa]] is an unincorporated and [[unorganized territory]] of the [[United States]], administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]], [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]]. Its constitution was ratified 1966 and came into effect 1967. [[Executive power]] is discharged by the governor and the lieutenant governor. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The party system is a based on the United States party system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThere is also the traditional village politics of the Samoa Islands, the \"[[faamatai]]\" and the \"[[faasamoa]]\", which continues in American Samoa and in independent Samoa, and which interacts across these current boundaries. The Fa\'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa\'amatai the protocols of the \"[[fono]]\" (council) and the chiefly system. The Fa\'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters. The \"matai\" (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent [[Samoa]].\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of American Samoa}}\n\nThe [[government of American Samoa]] is defined under the [[Constitution of American Samoa]]. As an [[unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]], the [[Ratification Act of 1929]] vested all civil, judicial, and military powers in the [[President of the United States|President]], who in turn delegated authority to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] in {{Executive Order|10264}}. The Secretary promulgated the [[Constitution of American Samoa]] which was approved by a Constitutional Convention of the people of American Samoa and a majority of the voters of American Samoa voting at the 1966 election, and came into effect in 1967.\n\nThe [[Governor of American Samoa]] is the [[head of government]] and along with the [[Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa]] is elected on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] by [[popular vote]] for four-year terms.\n\nThe [[legislative power]] is vested in the [[American Samoa Fono]], which has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]. The [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 18 members, elected for a two-year term, 17 in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] and one by a public meeting on [[Swain Island]]. The [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] also has 18 members, elected for a four-year term by and from the chiefs of the islands.\n\nThe [[judiciary of American Samoa]] is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the [[High Court of American Samoa]] is the highest court below the [[United States Supreme Court]] in American Samoa, with the District Courts below it. The High Court is located in the capital of [[Pago Pago]]. It consists of a Chief Justice and an Associate Justice, appointed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n:\'\'An overview on [[elections]] and election results is included in [[Elections in American Samoa]].\'\'\n{{American Samoa governor election, 2004}}\n{{American Samoa House election, 2006}}\n{{American Samoa Senate election, 2004}}\nAt the 2 November 2004 election Eni F.

Economic activity is strongly linked to the United States, with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its [[foreign trade]]. [[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa\'s economic well-being.

Tim Starling already answered them: I intervened here not as a direct participant, but in order to maintain the established and successful page layout - in other words, this is essentially a dispute between you and Tim Starling. I stepped in when I saw that you had reverted Tim\'s revert of your unwise changes. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]] 22:56, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nWhat was the explaination? \"it\'s not really something different to see, it\'s part of the same topic\"? My issue here is with a lack of standardization and relation between lumped articles. If it were the \'\'same\'\' topic, the \"Other topics\" label would not be necessary. How is \'\'other topics\'\' different from \'\'see also\'\'? Why should these articles be listed under the \'\'main article\'\' heading instead of below the section? What makes this situation so special that it is inapproprate for \'\'all\'\' other articles I have seen in WP?\n\nI don\'t see the logic behind lumping the articles under the topics they are placed under. Like all other countries, these articles are basically copied text from the CIA factbook/state dept. What makes Australia\'s transporation statistics so special that it should be listed under \"demographics\" rather than \"miscellaneous\". What\'s wrong with a miscenllaneous section?\n\nIf you and Tim believe the template needs to be changed, go argue that at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject_Countries]]. Don\'t unilaterally change the agreed upon style and format and make WP inconsistent. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 23:11, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nLook, I don\'t have time for this shit right now - I have to go. Meanwhile, just look over the mess you are making. For example, right in the first topic (history) you have blown away the section with a great deal of Australian political history: Australian Prime Ministers. Your \"work WITH me\" edit summaries are highly misleading - you had the oportunity to work WITH Tim, but chose not to. You had the opportunity to DISCUSS your proposed changes with the people who work in this topic area, but chose not to. For now, just go ahead and bugger it up, I\'ll fix it when I get back tonight. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n:We can only choose one section to put the PM article in. The PM article has closer relation with politics (since even the history is over the history of the role, ie, a political history) than with history in general, which has more to do with a wider range of events. Note the the PM articles for the UK, Canada, New Zealand (and probably more) are incorporated into the text of the politics section, as I have done here. The article focuses on what powers the PM has, not the policies of various past PM\'s. This makes it a political article.\n\n:Please cut the personal attacks. They\'re not helping. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 23:24, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\n----\n==Protected==\nI have protected this page. Of couse, the protection is entirely symbolic in this case. \n\nI provide these data for the interest of the disputants:\n\n*The miscellaneous links section is indeed part of WikiProject Countries. (See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries#Miscellaneous topics|WikiProject Countries#Miscellaneous topics]].) Having this section is the norm among country articles to which the template has been applied.\n\n* Inspecting [[Kuwait]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Mexico]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[Portugal]], I never found a list of \"other topics\". There was a smattering of \"see also\" lists; these were found at the bottom of the relevant sections, with the exception of the \"see also\" list under [[Romania#Politics]]. (There was a \"see also\" in the middle of a table in Mexico; but since it pertains only to a single table entry, it\'s not really germaine.)\n\nOn another topic, this whole conflict reminds me a lot of the recent edit war over VfD. Two experienced and trustworthy contributors get overexcited and somehow forget that \'\'anyone\'s\'\' change is easily undone. It just doesn\'t make sense to get into a revert war - it\'s wasted effort! It doesn\'t matter what format the article is in for a few hours today or tomorrow; continuous reverting is a hostile action, and is entirely counterproductive to the disputants\' efforts to understand and address each other\'s concerns.\n-- [[User:Cyan|Cyan]] 00:55, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nThank you for protecting the page, Cyan. However, you have protected the \'\'wrong version\'\'. In the case of a dispute, it is conventional and proper to use the last version \'\'prior to the dispute\'\', and most certainly not the version that the instigator of the dispute is insisting on. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]] \n\nThe page history was a little too messy to determine which version was pre-edit war, what with Jiang\'s edit being reverted by Tim Starling, whose changes were then reverted by Jiang and then reverted back and forth by Jiang and yourself, and other contributors making small changes in the middle. Under the premise that the question of which particular version is preserved for the cooling-off period is far less important than just moving the action to the talk page, I simply protected it in the condition I found it. In short, neither revision was \"wrong\" - both were temporary, and the version I protected on was luck of the draw. -- [[User:Cyan|Cyan]] 21:05, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\n----\n\n:: Actually on first inspection I\'m inclined to agree with Tannin re: placement of \"Military of...\" and some other sections.  However, we should respect the fine work in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countries]] and stick with their format.  Lots of thought and debate there have created a good boilerplate.  Think of it as freedom -- instead of wasting time on format, spend your energies on putting in good content, which is the value you bring to this article.  Also, threatening to use sysop powers to protect a page you\'re involved with is clearly against community policy, so don\'t do it. You\'ll have morning-after guilt. [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]] 00:13, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\n: Please, for the love of Mike \'\'read the edit history\'\'. I am NOT personally involved in this dispute. I stepped in to prevent Jiang buggering up the work of \'\'other people\'\' - not my work at all. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n:Whilst I personally prefer Tannin\'s version, other countries are listing their \"see also\'s\" at the end rather than directly under the \"main article\" link. See [[England]], [[United States]] and [[Spain]] for example. Consistency would be a good thing. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 00:42, Sep 21, 2003 (UTC)\n::: It is NOT \"Tannin\'s version\", Angela. Read the edit history, please. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n::I meant the version you were arguing for, not \'\'your\'\' version as such. [[User:Angela|Angela]]\n\nLet\'s get one thing straight right away. We are \'\'\'not\'\'\' talking about \'\'my\'\' version here, nor have \'\'I\'\' been involved  in the dispute, until I stepped in to protect \'\'other people\'s\'\' work from Jiang\'s revert-on-sight policy. (Read the edit history: it\'s all there.) I would indeed have protected the page earlier today - it is the duty of all sysops to stop revert-happy stupidities, and to do our best to allow the peope who create and improve content to get on with things free from interference by the likes of Jiang. Unfortunately, I had a 9:00AM appointment, and while protecting a page takes practically no time at all, it takes more time than I had available to post a properly detailed sest of reasons. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n:You are very much involved in the dispute and it would have been wrong for either one of you to protect the page. As well as editing the page, you have been expressing strong opinions on the talk page. Both of these things make you involved. [[User:Angela|Angela]]\n\nOn returning, I see that someone has protected \'\'\'the wrong version\'\'\'! This is crazy. If Jiang wants to horn in here (where he has no expertise and has never contributed anything of note), then the onus is on \'\'him\'\' to persuade the people who \'\'are\'\' working on these pages that his suggestions are good ones. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n:There is no \"wrong version\". The guidelines for protecting a page state that an admin \'\'may\'\' edit the page in order to revert to an old version, but they do not say that this must be done. I assume Cyan protected the page as it happened to be when he decided to protect it. I very much doubt he purposely waited for Jiang to make an edit before protecting it. [[User:Angela|Angela]]\n\nNow, let us turn to the meat of the matter, and examine the merits of the Jiang insists on so mindlessly:\n\nRight at the top, \'\'\'he deletes the links\'\'\' to two important Australian history topics: [[Australian Constitutional History]], and [[Australian Prime Ministers]]. Next he \'\'\'deletes the links\'\'\' aain: this time to three articles about political matters, only one of which gets a mention in the \"see also\" section he adds. I don\'t think anyone has an objection to setting a good, standard format and sticking to it - but deleting important links purely in order to mindlessly impose a particular format is not a good idea. \n\n\'\'Insisting\'\' on doing this in the face of objections (rather than being prepared to discuss things and work towards a mutually acceptable result) is very poor behaviour indeed. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]] 09:34, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\n:You are not required to be the original author to partake in an edit war. As long as you side with a certain content (or in this case, formatting), you are taking a side. If you were truly neutral, you would not care which version is used.\n\n:It is true that this formatting was originally inserted by Tim Starling and not you. However, this was not the \'\'original\'\' formatting. The current format (\"my format\") was present when the template was first implemented until Tim changed it against the established conventions. I can say too that I am preventing Tim Starling (not that I have anything against him) from \"buggering up the work of \'\'other people\'\'\" - all the people who created the country template.\n\n:Attacking me for lacking crediblity is a fallacy. I probably have worked with the country template more than you have. (This is besides the point. There is no need to prove to each other who has more experience here.) You still fail to convince \'\'us\'\' \'\'\'why this article deserves an exception to the established convention\'\'\'. Please discuss the issues. Don\'t attack the person.\n\n:Those links you claim have been deleted all are still on the page. Please check again. Now who is trying to elicit an explaination from whom? You\'re not convinving anyone here. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 09:47, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\n::The format is not an issue I care about either way. Well, Tim\'s version is better, but it\'s really a small point. However, deleting links is another question entirely. Restore the links you deleted, and (so far as I care) you can have any format you want (within reason). But, of course, this may or may not meet with the approval of other interested parties. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]] 09:55, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\n:::I did not delete any links. Do a CTRL-F and you\'ll find it on the page. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 09:56, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nIf I have to use control-F to find a link to an important article, whoever laid out the page is incompetent. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n:You don\'t have to. I don\'t have to. I just thought it would help since you seem to be having some difficulty seeing (or scrolling). Maybe the PM link is not prominent enough. The text should be reworded to include \"Prime Minister of Australia\" as a phrase so the entire link can be seen. Other than that, nothing is hidden. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 10:09, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nOK, let\'s try this. With your agreement, I\'ll unprotect the page and make what I see as the minimum required changes to it (i.e., edit your version so that the links work sensibly, as opposed to a complete revert of it). That should take 5 minutes or so. Then, you run your eye over the changes. If you are happy with them, problem solved. If we can\'t agree on them, then we revert to the current version (it really should be Tim\'s version, but I\'ll let that point go for the time being) and protect it again. Fair enough?\n\n(Note that this woud not commit any other users, of course, only you and me.) [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\nOkay...go ahead. I think it basically amounts to changing <nowiki>\"a [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]]\" to \"the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]\"</nowiki>. What else do you propose to change?

[[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\nDone. Probably a duplicate or two there still, bit close enough to give a general idea, in any case. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n----\n\nI just spent about 30 seconds scanning over this debate, so I can\'t comment in depth. But Jiang is right in one respect: we should go over to [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries]] and make our case. Our formatting is better than that of the other countries. I didn\'t apply my changes to the rest of the countries, due to selfish patriotic pride. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 13:06, Sep 21, 2003 (UTC)\n\nNo agreement from Jiang, restored the protection. (Correctly. it should be restored to the version BEFORE his edits, but in order to demonstrate fairness I restored Jiang\'s disputed version. I leave it to another sysop to restore the last \'\'non-controversial\'\' version, however - i.e., the Tim Starling version. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]] 00:22, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nOkay, I have now made my case at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries]]. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 01:41, Sep 22, 2003 (UTC)\n\nSummary of Tannin\'s edits and my comments:\n*moved \"Australian Constitutional History\" from \'\'see also\'\' under history section to part of the \'\'main articles\'\' list. - although I\'d rather not have it there, reserving the main article to the \'\'\'main\'\'\' article, I don\'t really mind since this \'\'is\'\' a history article\n*Added \"Republic Advisory Committee\" and \"Foreign relations of Australia\" to the \'\'see also\'\' list of the politics section - First, \"Republic Advisory Committee\" is already there. Don\'t link it twice on the same line! Second, foreign relations should be at the miscellaneous section since that is how the template has it. I see how it relates to politics, but moving it there would require we change the template (and have some mention of foreign relations be added to the discussion of government in that section).\n*Moved \"Australian birds\" from the \'\'see also\'\' list to the \'\'main article list Flora and Fauna - Please reserve \'\'main articles\'\' for just that. Birds are only a subset of the fauna, obviously not qualifying as a \"main\" article.Perhaps the link could be incorporated into the text, which only discusses flora at this moment.\n--[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 01:44, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n:: Crap. Australian birds are quite extraordinary, and have great significance. The linked article does not yet explain this (someone, probably me, should do a major re-write), but (a) Australia has ~900 species, significantly more than you would expect from its small land ara relative to other continents, particularly so given that the continent is so barren. and (b) the development of birds in [[Australia-New Guinea]] was crucial to the development of bird life worldwide: more than half of all living birds are passerines: i.e., they are directly descended from the birds of Australasia. So far as worldwide significance goes, Australian plants are \'\'not\'\' important, and neither are Australian mammals, reptiles, or any other group. The birds, however, \'\'are\'\'. In short, if you don\'t understand a subject, you shouldn\'t try to edit it. If you do edit it anyway, that\'s fine, but be prepared to accept corrections to your work from people who do know what they are taliking about. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]] 04:16, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nJust because Australian birds are unique does not elevate them to a higher category. If australian birds could munch off the heads of humans, they would still be birds. Being special does not make them \"all animals.\" It\'s not about the importance. It\'s about the scope of the article. If you think birds are so important, create a new section. If the section is not entitled \"birds\", it can\'t be considered a \"main article.\" Get you vocabulary straight. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 05:28, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n\nEven if we put [[Australian birds]] in the main articles of \"Flora and Fauna\", people may not realise how important it is.

Indeed, I have contributed many thousands of words on that very topic. Over time, I expect to add as many more. But yes, as Tim says, the birds have a special significance.

[[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\n:::::Address the issues. My cotribution record is irrelevant here. I am not adding content to the page. The dipute is over the formatting.

I felt this was unfortunate, but necessary. My goal was to move the action out of the article namespace and into the talk namespace; even though the protection was symbolic, in the sense that it had no hard-security-type binding power on the disputing parties, I believe it was effective nonetheless.

Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the \'\'Metaphysics\'\' of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by [[Farabi]], which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.\n\nHe turned to medicine at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment. The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18,<ref name=Britannica2008/> and found that \"Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]], so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies.\" The youthful physician\'s fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment.\n\n===Adulthood===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A drawing of Avicenna from 1271{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}<!-- identify the ms., the \"1271\" date was just found floating around on the internet.-->]]\n\nIbn Sina\'s first appointment was that of physician to the [[emir]], [[Nuh II]], who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Ibn Sina\'s chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.\n\nWhen Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of Ibn Sina\'s treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his \'\'Canon of Medicine\'\' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].\n\nIbn Sina subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina\'s shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamad?n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel\'s house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the \'\'Canon\'\' and the \'\'Sanatio\'\', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.\n\nMeanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya\'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad?n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna\'s \'\'Canon\'\', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]\n[[File:Gravestone of Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|Gravestone of Avicenna, [[Hamedan]], Iran]]\nThe remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn S?n?\'s life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]], whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.\n\nDuring these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.\n\nHis friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately.

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S?n?, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.\n\nFollowing al-Farabi\'s lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (\'\'Mahiat\'\') and existence (\'\'Wujud\'\'). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia| authorlink= |title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclop?dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archivedate= 22 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAvicenna\'s consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (\'\'mumkin bi-dhatihi\'\') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a \'necessary existent due to what is other than itself\' (\'\'wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi\'\'). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (\'\'wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi\'\') is true in itself, while the contingent being is \'false in itself\' and \'true due to something else other than itself\'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, \'\'Kitab al-shifa\', Metaphysics II\'\', (eds.) G. C.

In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body\'s afterlife.\n\nThere are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W.

[[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul\'s separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to [[nature]]. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\n{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted, and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant off it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000\"/><ref>Ibn Sina, \'\'???? ?????? ?? ????????? ?? ???? ?????? ????? ?????\'\' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d\'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|??? ?? ????? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ????? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ???????? ???? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ????? ?? ????? ??? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?????? ??? ????? ??? ????? ?? ????? ?? ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ????? ??????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????? ??? ????? ??? ?????? ??? ????? ?? ??????? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ???  ?? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ???  ????? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?? ?????? ??? ???? ?? ???? ???????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ???? ????? ???? ???? ?????? ????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??? ???? ??????? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ?? ???? ??? ?? ????? ??? ???? ????? ????? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ???? ???? ?? ?????? ?? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ????? ??? ?? ???? ????.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.  Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the flying person would be \"I am,\" affirming his or her essence.

Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty.\" Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (\'\'istiqra\'\'), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (\'\'tajriba\'\'). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|volume=41|issue=3|date=July 2003|pages=307?327|doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>\n\n===Logic===\nAn early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], \'\'[[Encyclop?dia Britannica]]\'\'.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between \'\'temporalis\'\' and the implication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Springer |author=Peter ?hrstr?m, Per Hasle |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna\'s work was further developed by [[Najm al-D?n al-Qazw?n? al-K?tib?]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{citation |title=TOWARD A HISTORY OF SYLLOGISTIC AFTER AVICENNA: NOTES ON RESCHER\'S STUDIES ON ARABIC MODAL LOGIC |author=TONY STREET |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=209?228}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |pages=247?265 |editors=Peter Adamson and Richard C.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher\'s connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna\'s Psychology.

The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | page=75 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}</ref> The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883#Bligh reclaims the Ashes 1882/3|1882?83 series played in Australia]], before which the English captain [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] had vowed to \"regain those ashes\". The English media therefore dubbed the tour \'\'the quest to regain the Ashes\'\'.\n\nAfter England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women including [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], whom Bligh married within a year.<ref name=events>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/63185850 Summary of Events] \'\'[[The Illustrated Australian News]]\'\', 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden [[bail (cricket)|bail]], and were humorously described as \"the ashes of Australian cricket\".<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12673335 Cricket] \'\'[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]\'\', 4 June 1908, p.8, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> It is not clear whether that \"tiny silver urn\" is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] by Bligh\'s widow after his death in 1927.\n\n[[The Ashes urn|The urn]] has never been the official trophy of the Ashes series, having been a personal gift to Bligh.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ashes History|url=http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-history/the-ashes |publisher=Lords}}</ref> However, [[replica]]s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series. Since the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1998?99|1998?99 Ashes series]], a [[Waterford Crystal]] representation of the Ashes urn (called the Ashes Trophy) has been presented to the winners of an Ashes series as the official trophy of that series. Whichever side holds the Ashes, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at [[Lord\'s Cricket Ground|Lord\'s]]; it has however been taken to Australia to be put on touring display on two occasions: as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, and to accompany the [[English cricket team in Australia in 2006?07|Ashes series in 2006?07]].\n\nAn Ashes series is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every four years. {{As of|2015|08}}, England hold the ashes, having won three of the five Tests in the [[2015 Ashes series]]. Overall, Australia has won 32 series, England 32 and five series have been drawn.\n\n==1882 origins==\n{{main|Australian cricket team in England in 1882}}\n[[File:Ranji 1897 page 143 F. R. Spofforth, the demon bowler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fred Spofforth]], \"The Demon Bowler\", was instrumental in Australia\'s 1882 victory over England with 14 wickets for 90.]]\nThe first [[Test cricket|Test match]] between England and Australia was played in [[Melbourne]], Australia, [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876?77|in 1877]], though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. On their [[Australian cricket team in England and the United States in 1882|tour of England]] that year the Australians played just one Test, at [[the Oval]] in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|wicket]].<ref>Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well.</ref> Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first [[innings]], and England, led by [[A. N. Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In their second innings, the Australians, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from [[Hugh Massie]], managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler [[Fred Spofforth]], spurred on by the [[gamesmanship]] of his opponents, in particular [[W. G. Grace]], refused to give in. \"This thing can be done,\" he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory.\n\nWhen [[Ted Peate]], England\'s last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by [[Harry Boyle]]. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.\n\nWhen Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, [[Charles Studd]] (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists), to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, \"I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n|first=Jack\n|last=Worrall\n|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/83580262\n|title=A Great Bowlers\' Victory\n|page=11 \n|newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] \n|location=Perth, WA |date=23 August 1930 \n|accessdate=25 August 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful \"pluck\" and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof. A celebrated poem appeared in \'\'[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]\'\' on Saturday, 9 September. The first verse, quoted most frequently, reads:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWell done, [[wikt:cornstalk|Cornstalks]]! Whipt us\nFair and square,\nWas it luck that tript us?\nWas it scare?\nKangaroo Land\'s \'Demon\', or our own\nWant of \'devil\', coolness, nerve, backbone?\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nOn 31 August, in the [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]]-edited magazine \'\'Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game\'\', there appeared a mock obituary:\n\n:\'\'SACRED TO THE MEMORY\'\'\n:\'\'OF\'\'\n:\'\'ENGLAND\'S SUPREMACY IN THE\'\'\n:\'\'CRICKET-FIELD\'\'\n:\'\'WHICH EXPIRED\'\'\n:\'\'ON THE 29TH DAY OF AUGUST, AT THE OVAL\'\'\n:\'\'\"ITS END WAS PEATE\"\'\'\n\n[[File:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|thumb|The death notice that appeared in \'\'[[The Sporting Times]]\'\']]\nOn 2 September a more celebrated mock obituary, written by [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]], appeared in \'\'[[The Sporting Times]]\'\'. It read:\n\n:\'\'In Affectionate Remembrance\'\'\n:\'\'of\'\'\n:\'\'ENGLISH CRICKET,\'\'\n:\'\'which died at the Oval\'\'\n:\'\'on\'\'\n:\'\'29 August 1882,\'\'\n:\'\'Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing\'\'\n:\'\'friends and acquaintances\'\'\n\n:\'\'R.I.P.\'\'\n\n:\'\'N.B.?The body will be cremated and the\'\'\n:\'\'ashes taken to Australia.\'\'\n\n[[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] promised that on [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882?83|1882?83 tour of Australia]], he would, as England\'s captain, \"recover those Ashes\". He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn the 20 years following Bligh\'s campaign the term \"the Ashes\" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when [[George Giffen]], in his memoirs (\'\'With Bat and Ball\'\', 1899), used the term as if it were well known.<ref>Gibson, A., \'\'Cricket Captains of England\'\', p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain \"the ashes\". As had been the case on Bligh\'s tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term and, this time, it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled \'\'How We Recovered the Ashes\'\'. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of \"the Ashes\" in [[Wisden Cricketers\' Almanack]] occurs in 1905, while \'\'Wisden\'\'\'s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.\n\n==Urn==\n{{Main|The Ashes urn}}\n[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest published photo of [[the Ashes urn]], from \'\'[[The Illustrated London News]]\'\', 1921]]\n[[File:Rupertswood mansion side angle shot.jpg|thumb|[[Rupertswood]] outside Melbourne, where the urn was presented to Bligh]]\nAs it took many years for the name \"the Ashes\" to be given to ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in \'\'The Cricketers Annual\'\':\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nSo here\'s to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,\nGilligan, Woolley and Hearne\nMay they bring back to the Motherland,\nThe ashes which have no urn!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody the Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian captain M. A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian captain W. M. Woodfull in 1934.\n\nThe oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882?83 tour. The precise nature of the origin of [[The Ashes urn|this urn]] is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley in 1894, it was believed that a group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] ladies, including Darnley\'s later wife [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis<ref>{{Cite book| first=Ronald | last=Willis | title=Cricket\'s Biggest Mystery: The Ashes | isbn=0-7270-1768-3}}</ref> and Joy Munns<ref>{{Cite book| first=Joy | last=Munns | title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The birthplace of the Ashes | isbn=0-646-22153-1}}</ref> have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of [[Sir William John Clarke|Sir William Clarke]], at his property \"[[Rupertswood]]\", in [[Sunbury, Victoria]]. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.\n\nIn August 1926 Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) displayed the Ashes urn at the \'\'[[Morning Post]]\'\' Decorative Art Exhibition held in the Central Hall, Westminster. He made the following statement about how he was given the urn:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/58247421?searchTerm=darnley%20cricket%20ashes&searchLimits= |title=Sunday Times (Perth) 15 August 1926 page 9S.

Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:<ref>The Times (London), 27 June 1930. page 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In 1882, she said, it was first spoken of when the Sporting Times, after the Australians had thoroughly beaten the English at the Oval, wrote an obituary in affectionate memory of English cricket \"whose demise was deeply lamented and the body would be cremated and taken to Australia\". Her husband, then Ivo Bligh, took a team to Australia in the following year. Punch had a poem containing the words \"When Ivo comes back with the urn\" and when Ivo Bligh wiped out the defeat Lady Clarke, wife of Sir W. J. Clarke, who entertained the English so lavishly, found a little wooden urn, burnt a bail, put the ashes in the urn, and wrapping it in a red velvet bag, put it into her husband\'s (Ivo Bligh\'s) hands. He had always regarded it as a great treasure.}}\n\nThere is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn. He was interviewed in his home at Cobham Hall by Montague Grover and the report of this interview was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/66512851?searchTerm=%22cobham%20hall%22%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192 |title=Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1.

However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now \"95% certain\" that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of [[terracotta]] and is about {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.\n\n[[File:Ashes song.jpg|thumb|The full version of the song from the \'\'[[Melbourne Punch]]\'\', the fourth verse of which is pasted onto the urn]]\nA label containing a six-line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in the \'\'[[Melbourne Punch]]\'\' on 1 February 1883:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWhen [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;\n[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A G Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;\nThe [[wikt:make the welkin ring|welkin]] will ring loud,\nThe great crowd will feel proud,\nSeeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;\nAnd the rest coming home with the urn.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]], was given to Bligh to contain the urn.\n\nDuring Darnley\'s lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921.  \'\'[[The Illustrated London News]]\'\' published this photo in January 1921 (shown above).\n\nWhen Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at [[Lord\'s Cricket Ground]] and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC\'s wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy.\n\nIt is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.\n\nBecause the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6052544.stm | title=Ashes urn heads to Australia |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the [[Museum of Sydney]]. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.\n\nIn the 1990s, given Australia\'s long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as \"the Ashes\", the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh\'s great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]], argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.\n\nAs a compromise, the MCC commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in [[Waterford Crystal]], to award to the winning team of each series from 1998?99. This is known as the Ashes Trophy.<ref>[http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy/ \"What is the Ashes Trophy?\"], Lord\'s website.

Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by [[Result (cricket)|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have \"won back the Ashes\" 2?1. A fourth match was played, against a \"United Australian XI\", which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882?83 series. It \'\'is\'\' counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia\n\n===1884 to 1896===\nAfter Bligh\'s victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894?95. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.\n\nThere was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887?88, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking their first series win since 1882 with a 2?1 victory in 1891?92. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.\n\nThe [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|1894?95]] series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 ([[Syd Gregory]] 201, [[George Giffen]] 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with [[Bobby Peel]] taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day\'s play, Australia were 113?2, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3?2 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and [[Tom Richardson]], with 32 at 26.53.\n\nIn 1896 England under the captaincy of [[W. G. Grace]] won the series 2?1, and this marked the end of England\'s longest period of Ashes dominance.\n\n===1897 to 1902===\nAustralia resoundingly won the 1897?98 series by 4?1 under the captaincy of [[Harry Trott]]. His successor [[Joe Darling]] won the next three series in 1899, 1901?02 and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|classic 1902 series]], which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.\n\nFive matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 ([[Wilfred Rhodes]] 7/17) and reduced them to 46?2 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at [[Bramall Lane]] and [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after [[Victor Trumper]] had scored 104 on a \"bad wicket\", reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at [[The Oval]] by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, they slumped to 48?5 before [[Gilbert Jessop|Jessop\'s]] 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last-wicket pair of [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]] and Rhodes were required to score 15 runs for victory. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst reportedly said: \"We\'ll get them in singles, Wilfred.\" In fact, they scored thirteen singles and a two.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152487.html The glorious uncertainty]</ref>\n\nThe period of Darling\'s captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[James Kelly (cricketer)|James Kelly]], [[Monty Noble]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]].\n\n===Reviving the legend===\nAfter what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903?04. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book \'\'How We Recovered The Ashes\'\'.<ref>[[Plum Warner]], \'\'How We Recovered The Ashes\'\', Longman, 1905</ref> The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as \"The Ashes\".\n\n===1905 to 1912===\nEngland and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England\'s captain [[Stanley Jackson]] not only won the series 2?0, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907?08 and 1909. Then England won in 1911?12 by four matches to one. [[Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as England\'s first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] (32 wickets at 21.62) and [[Sydney Barnes]] (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.\n\nEngland retained the Ashes when they won the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], which also featured [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|dispute]] between the board and players that caused [[Clem Hill]], [[Victor Trumper]], Warwick Armstrong, [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Sammy Carter]] and [[Vernon Ransford]] to be omitted.<ref>Harte, pp. 251?256.</ref>\n\n===1920 to 1933===\nAfter the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]] crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. They won the first eight matches in succession including a 5?0 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920-21|1920?1921]] at the hands of Warwick Armstrong\'s team.\n\nThe ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.\n\n[[File:Herbert Sutcliffe 1924.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Sutcliffe]] sweeps [[Arthur Mailey]] during the first Ashes Test in Sydney, 1924.]]\nEngland won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.<ref>Harte, pp. 274?276.</ref><ref name=auslist>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru ?

Because the series was at stake, the match was to be \"timeless\", i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] took the score to 49?0 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably.<ref>Harte, pp. 298?301.</ref> Australian captain [[Herbie Collins]] was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.\n\nAustralia\'s ageing post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Warren Bardsley]] all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928?29 series.\n\nDespite the debut of [[Donald Bradman]], the inexperienced Australians, led by [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], were heavily defeated, losing 4?1.<ref>Harte, pp. 312?316.</ref> England had a very strong batting side, with [[Wally Hammond]] contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and [[Patsy Hendren]] all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.\n\nIn 1930, [[Bill Woodfull]] led an extremely inexperienced team to England.\n\nBradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying \"I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia.\"<ref name=\"Don Bradman on australianscreen online\">{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/1930-australian-xi-ashes/|title=Don Bradman in \'The 1930 Australian XI: Winners of the Ashes\' on australianscreen online|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> In the [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at [[Lord\'s Cricket Ground|Lord\'s]], was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by [[Percy Hornibrook]] in England\'s second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2?1. [[Clarrie Grimmett]]\'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.\n\nAustralia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, [[Archie Jackson]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Bill Woodfull]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England\'s 1932?33 captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to adopt the tactic of fast [[leg theory]], better known as [[Bodyline]].\n\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]\n\nJardine instructed his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]], most notably [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked [[leg side|leg-side]] field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it \"leg theory\" but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it \"Bodyline\" (from \"on the line of the body\"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4?1, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[Laws of cricket]] to curtail the number of leg side fielders.\n\nJardine\'s comment was: \"I\'ve not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends. I\'m here to win the Ashes\".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Top 50 British achievements | first=Patrick | last=Kidd | date=4 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome of the Australians wanted to use Bodyline in retaliation, but Woodfull flatly refused. He famously told England manager [[Pelham Warner]], \"There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket; the other is making no attempt to do so\" after the latter had come into the Australian rooms to express sympathy for a Larwood bouncer had struck the Australian skipper in the heart and felled him.<ref>Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster (1997). \'\'The A-Z of Australian cricketers\'\', pp. 322?323.</ref>\n\n===1934 to 1953===\nOn the batting-friendly [[cricket pitch|wickets]] that prevailed in the late 1930s, most Tests up to the Second World War still gave results. It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.\n\nThe 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia. It should be noted that the MCC, although it had earlier condoned and encouraged {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} bodyline tactics in the 1932?33 series, laid the blame on Larwood when relations turned sour. Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.\n\nAustralia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, though no Test cricket was played during the Second World War.\n\nAs in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707-run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2?1.<ref>Harte, pp. 356?357.</ref> This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.\n\nIn 1936?37 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on [[sticky wicket]]s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3?2.\n\nThe 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1?1 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was [[Len Hutton]]\'s then world-record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] injured themselves during Hutton\'s marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runs,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6109836.stm Classic Ashes clashes - 1938, The Oval] at [[BBC Sport]], 5 November 2006. Accessed 4 March 2006</ref> the heaviest in Test history.\n\nThe Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946?47 and, as in 1920?21, found that Australia had made the better post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new-ball partnership of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], Australia were convincing 3?0 winners.\n\nAged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to [[Jack Ikin]]; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain\'s favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.\n\nIn 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying their hosts to win 4?0 with one draw. This [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team]], led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as \'\'The Invincibles\'\'. Playing 34 matches on tour?three of which were not first-class?and including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing 7.\n\nBradman\'s men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second]] and [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Tests]] at Lord\'s and Headingley respectively. Before a record attendance of spectators at Headingley, Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.\n\nThe 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the [[Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test]] at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career [[batting average]] of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second-ball duck, bowled by an [[Eric Hollies]] googly<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8036237.stm 1948 - Bradman\'s final innings duck] at [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2009. Accessed 4 March 2015</ref> that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.\n\nBradman was succeeded as Australian captain by [[Lindsay Hassett]], who led the team to a 4?1 series victory in 1950?51. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.\n\nThe tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1?0, having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Tom Graveney]], [[Colin Cowdrey]], bowlers [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Tony Lock]], wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] and all-rounder [[Trevor Bailey]].\n\n===1954 to 1971===\n[[File:Peter May.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] driving [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] on his way to a century at Sydney.]]\nIn [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|1954?55]], Australia\'s batsmen had no answer to the pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3?1.<ref>Harte, pp. 435?437.</ref>\n\nA dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner [[Jim Laker]]\'s monumental effort at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test.<ref>Harte, pp. 444?446.</ref> It was Australia\'s second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2?1 as England\'s best ever.\n\nEngland\'s dominance was not to last. Australia won 4?0 in 1958?59, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper [[Richie Benaud]], who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman [[Alan Davidson (cricketer, born 1929)|Alan Davidson]], who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably [[Ian Meckiff]], whom the English management and media accused of [[throwing (cricket)|illegally throwing]] Australia to victory.\n\nAustralia consolidated their status as the leading team in world cricket with a hard-fought 2?1 away series. After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord\'s, dubbed \"The Battle of the Ridge\" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series after a heavy collapse during the English runchase.\n\nThe tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962?63, 1964, 1965?66 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australian captains [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]] were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for [[apartheid]], completely outplayed Australia 3?1 and 4?0. Australia had lost 2?1 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964?65, the first time they had lost a series to any team other than England.\n\nIn 1970?71, [[Ray Illingworth]] led England to a 2?0 win in Australia, mainly due to [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]]\'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[John Edrich]]. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England\'s success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia\'s lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.<ref>Harte, pp. 526?530.</ref>\n\n===1972 to 1987===\nThe 1972 series finished 2?2, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.<ref>Harte, pp. 538?540.</ref>\n\nIn the 1974?75 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Dennis Lillee]] wreaked havoc. A 4?1 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked.<ref>Harte, pp. 557?559.</ref> England then lost the 1975 series 0?1, but at least restored some pride under new captain [[Tony Greig]].<ref>Harte, pp. 561?563.</ref>\n\nAustralia won the 1977 Centenary Test<ref>Harte, pp. 580?581.</ref> which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as [[Kerry Packer]] announced his intention to form [[World Series Cricket]].<ref>Harte, pp. 579?590</ref> WSC affected all Test-playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.\n\nWith Greig having joined WSC, England appointed [[Mike Brearley]] as their captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley\'s men won the 1977 series 3?0 and then completed an overwhelming 5?1 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978?79. [[Allan Border]] made his Test debut for Australia in 1978?79.\n\nBrearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Ian Botham]], who started the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1981|1981 series]] as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1?0 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2?0 series lead after they had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, [[Bob Willis]] taking 8?43. It was the first time since 1894?95 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley\'s leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.<ref>Harte, pp. 627?628.</ref>\n\nIn 1982?83 Australia had [[Greg Chappell]] back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their [[South African rebel tours|South African tour rebels]], particularly [[Graham Gooch]] and [[John Emburey]]. Australia went 2?0 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.<ref>Harte, pp. 636?637.</ref>\n\nIn 1985 [[David Gower]]\'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]] and [[Mike Gatting]]. Australia, now captained by [[Allan Border]], had themselves been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of [[Terry Alderman]] being a particular factor. England won 3?1.\n\nDespite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes. Mike Gatting was the captain in 1986?87 but his team started badly and attracted some criticism.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/268042.html | title=Can\'t bat, can\'t bowl, can\'t field | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | last=Miller | first=Andrew |author2=Martin Williamson  | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> Then [[Chris Broad]] scored three hundreds in successive Tests and bowling successes from [[Graham Dilley]] and [[Gladstone Small]] meant England won the series 2?1.<ref>Harte, pp. 662?664.</ref>\n\n===1989 to 2003===\n[[File:MCG99.jpg|right|thumb|[[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] Boxing Day Test 1998]]\nThe Australian team of 1989 was comparable to the great Australian teams of the past, and resoundingly defeated England 4?0.<ref>Harte, pp. 679?682.</ref> Well led by [[Allan Border]], the team included the young cricketers [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Merv Hughes]], [[David Boon]], [[Ian Healy]] and [[Steve Waugh]], who were all to prove long-serving and successful Ashes competitors.

After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990?91, 1993, 1994?95, 1997, 1998?99, 2001 and 2002?03 series, all by convincing margins.\n\nGreat Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother [[Mark Waugh|Mark]], scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Jason Gillespie]] made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by [[Ian Healy]] for most of the 1990s and by [[Adam Gilchrist]] from 2001 to 2006?07. In the 2000s, batsmen [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]], whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the [[Ball of the century]].\n\nAustralia\'s record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England\'s 86, 74 tests having been drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+1989;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> By the 2005 series Australia\'s test wins had increased to 115 whereas England\'s had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+2005;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws.

This elevated them to second in the [[ICC Test Championship]]. Hopes that the [[2005 Ashes series]] would be closely fought proved well-founded, the series remaining undecided as the closing session of the final Test began. Experienced journalists including Richie Benaud rated the series as the most exciting in living memory. It has been compared with the great series of the distant past, such as 1894?95 and 1902.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe First Test at [[Lord\'s Cricket Ground|Lord\'s]] was convincingly won by Australia, but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and England fought back to win the Second Test by 2 runs, the smallest winning margin in Ashes history, and the second-smallest in all Tests. The rain-affected Third Test ended with the last two Australian batsmen holding out for a draw; and England won the Fourth Test by three wickets after forcing Australia to [[follow-on]] for the first time in 191 Tests being a period of 17 years. A draw in the final Test gave England victory in an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first Ashes victory at home since 1985.\n\nAustralia regained the Ashes on their home turf in the [[2006-07 Ashes series|2006?07 series]] with a convincing 5?0 victory, only the second time an Ashes series has been won by that margin. [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Shane Warne]] and [[Justin Langer]] retired from Test cricket after that series, while [[Damien Martyn]] retired during the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6513.html|title=Damien Martyn|publisher=cricinfo}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ashes 2010-11 Sydney Test final wicket.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chris Tremlett]] bowls [[Michael Beer (cricketer)|Michael Beer]] to complete England\'s 3?1 Ashes victory on 7 January 2011]]\n\nThe [[2009 Ashes series|2009 series]] began with a tense draw in the First Test at [[SWALEC Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], with England\'s last-wicket batsmen [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] surviving 69 balls. England then achieved its first Ashes win at Lord\'s since 1934 to go 1?0 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. [[Andrew Flintoff]] retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.\n\nThe [[2010?11 Ashes series|2010?11 series]] was played in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 and 258) by an innings and 157 runs. This gave England an unbeatable 2?1 lead in the series and so they retained the Ashes. England went on to win the series 3?1, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938. England then bowled Australia out again for 281. England\'s series victory was its first on Australian soil for 24 years. The 2010?11 Ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.\n\nAustralia\'s build-up to the [[2013 Ashes series]] was far from ideal. [[Darren Lehmann]] took over as coach from [[Mickey Arthur]]<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-24/lehmann-named-australian-coach/4777030 Ashes 2013: Darren Lehmann replaces Mickey Arthur as Australia coach; Clarke steps down as selector] at [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 24 June 2013.

In the face of high-class swing bowling from [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]], who ended with 10 wickets in the match, Australia collapsed to 117?9. However, debutant 19-year-old [[Ashton Agar]] made a world-record 98 for a number 11 and [[Phillip Hughes|Phil Hughes]] an unbeaten 81 to secure an unlikely lead of 65. England\'s second-innings total of 375 set Australia a target of 311, against which they fell short by only 14 runs in a tense finish. In the Second Test, England beat Australia by 347 runs in a very one-sided contest. In the Third Test, held at a newly refurbished Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. They amassed a commanding score of 527?7, led by captain Michael Clarke\'s 187. The pressure was then on the home side to avoid the follow-on. England scored 368 with a century for Kevin Pietersen. Australia\'s second innings score was 172?7 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping their series hopes alive. By lunch England were 37?3, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play. This rain persisted and, at 16:40, the captains shook hands and the match was declared a draw. With England 2?0 up with two tests to play, England retained the Ashes on 5 August 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sheringham |first=Sam |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23579840 |title=Ashes 2013: England retain Ashes as rain forces Old Trafford draw |work=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the Fourth Test, England won the toss and batted first, putting on 238 runs, Australia took a narrow lead scoring 270 in their first innings.

Following a rain delay, Australia crashed to a 74-run defeat, losing all eight wickets for only 86 runs. England had taken 9 wickets in the final session of the fourth day. Stuart Broad was England\'s top wicket-taker in the match with 11 wickets. England held a 3?0 lead going into the final Fifth Test at The Oval.\n\nThe final Test was drawn. On the fourth day no play was possible due to rain, but on the final day after an aggressive Australian declaration, England came close to achieving its first 4?0 victory in an Ashes series.

In the next two Tests, the Australian batsmen struggled, being bowled out for 136 in the first innings at [[Edgbaston]] , with England proceeding to win by eight wickets.

The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] rivalry between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[The Ashes (rugby league)|rugby league \"Ashes\"]]). Use of the name \"Ashes\" was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908. Other examples included the television game shows \'\'[[Gladiators (TV series)|Gladiators]]\'\' and \'\'[[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|Sale of the Century]]\'\', both of which broadcast special editions containing contestants from the Australian and English versions of the shows competing against each other.\n\nThe term became further genericised in Australia in the first half of the twentieth century, and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of Australia vs England.

'Analysis'	'{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\'\'\'Analysis\'\'\' is the process of breaking a [[complexity|complex topic]] or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384?322 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]), though \'\'analysis\'\' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Analysis|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Michael Beaney|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Michael Beaney|year=Summer 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ????????

For an example of its use, analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing a [[nuclear reactor]], so [[nuclear scientist]]s will analyze [[neutron activation analysis|neutron activation]] to develop discrete measurements within vast samples. A [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] can have a considerable effect on the way a chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results. Analysis can be done manually or with a [[analyzer|device]]. Chemical analysis is an important element of [[national security]] among the [[great power|major world powers]] with [[Materials MASINT|materials]] [[measurement and signature intelligence]] (MASINT) capabilities.\n\n====Isotopes====\n{{See also|Isotope analysis|Isotope geochemistry}}\nChemists can use [[isotope analysis]] to assist analysts with issues in [[anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[food chemistry]], [[forensics]], [[geology]], and a host of other questions of [[physical science]].

[[Electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] analyse [[system analysis|systems]] in [[electronics]]. [[Whole-life cost|Life cycles]] and [[Accident analysis|system failures]] are broken down and studied by engineers. It is also looking at different factors incorporated within the design.\n\n===Intelligence===\n{{See also|Intelligence analysis}}\nThe field of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] employs analysts to break down and understand a wide array of questions. [[Intelligence agency|Intelligence agencies]] may use [[heuristics]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]], [[social network analysis]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[Social network#Social network analysis|link analysis]], and [[brainstorming]] to sort through problems they face. [[Military intelligence]] may explore issues through the use of [[game theory]], [[Red Team]]ing, and [[military simulation|wargaming]]. [[Signals intelligence]] applies [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]] to break [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s. [[Business intelligence]] applies theories of [[competitive intelligence|competitive intelligence analysis]] and [[competitor analysis]] to resolve questions in the [[marketplace]]. [[Police|Law enforcement]] intelligence applies a number of theories in [[crime analysis]].\n\n===Linguistics===\n{{See also|Linguistics}}\nLinguistics look at individual languages and [[language]] in general. It breaks language down and analyses its component parts: [[theoretical linguistics|theory]], [[phonology|sounds and their meaning]], [[pragmatics|utterance usage]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word origins]], the [[etymology|history of words]], the meaning of [[lexical semantics|words]] and [[phraseology|word combinations]], [[syntax|sentence construction]], [[discourse analysis|basic construction beyond the sentence level]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], and [[conversation analysis|conversation]].

It also takes the [[applied linguistics|applied]] approach, looking at [[developmental linguistics|individual language development]] and [[clinical linguistics|clinical]] issues.\n\n===Literature===\n[[Literary criticism]] is the analysis of [[literature]]. The focus can be as diverse as the analysis of [[analysis (Homer)|Homer]] or [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freud]]. While not all literary-critical methods are primarily analytical in nature, the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid-twentieth century, literary formal analysis or close reading, is. This method, rooted in the academic movement labelled [[The New Criticism]], approaches texts - chiefly short poems such as [[sonnets]], which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis - as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves, without reference to biographical or historical frameworks. This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]], and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Main|Mathematical analysis}}\n\nModern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus.  It can be applied in the study of [[classical mathematics|classical]] concepts of mathematics, such as [[real analysis|real numbers]], [[complex analysis|complex variables]], [[Fourier analysis|trigonometric functions]], and [[numerical analysis|algorithms]], or of [[non-classical analysis|non-classical]] concepts like [[constructivist analysis|constructivism]], [[harmonic analysis|harmonics]], [[non-standard analysis|infinity]], and [[functional analysis|vectors]].\n\n[[Florian Cajori]] explains in [[wikiquote:A History of Mathematics|\'\'A History of Mathematics\'\']] (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:\n<blockquote>\nThe terms \'\'synthesis\'\' and \'\'analysis\'\' are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in  [appended to] [[Euclid\'s Elements|Euclid]], XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]: \"Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it.\" \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions.\n</blockquote>\n\nJames Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his [http://books.google.com/books?id=KSe_ZEmHaXEC& \'\'A Short History of Greek Mathematics\'\'] (1884):\n\n<blockquote>\nThe synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished \'\'theoretic\'\' from \'\'problematic\'\' analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To \'\'prove\'\' that A is B, \'\'assume\'\' first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be [[wiktionary:convertible#Adjective|convertible]], then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Music===\n* [[Musical analysis]]&nbsp;? a process attempting to answer the question \"How does this music work?\"\n* [[Schenkerian analysis]]\n\n===Philosophy===\n* [[Philosophical analysis]]&nbsp;? a general term for the techniques used by philosophers\n* \'\'[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]\'\' is the name of a prominent journal in philosophy.\n\n===Psychotherapy===\n* [[Psychoanalysis]]&nbsp;? seeks to elucidate connections among unconscious components of patients\' mental processes\n* [[Transactional analysis]]\n\n===Signal processing===\n* [[Finite element analysis]]&nbsp;? a computer simulation technique used in engineering analysis\n* [[Independent component analysis]]\n* [[Link quality analysis]]&nbsp;? the analysis of signal quality\n* [[Path quality analysis]]\n* [[Fourier analysis]]\n\n===Statistics===\nIn [[statistics]], the term \'\'analysis\'\' may refer to any method used\nfor [[data analysis]].

January 26, 1893) was a career [[United States Army]] officer and [[Union Army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]]. He fired the first shot in defense of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]] caused lasting enmity between the two men. In [[San Francisco]], after the war, he obtained a patent on the [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] railway that still runs there. In his final years in [[New Jersey]], he was a prominent member and later president of the [[Theosophical Society]].

Doubleday]] and Hester Donnelly, was born in [[Ballston Spa, New York]], in a small house on the corner of Washington and Fenwick streets. As a child, Abner was very short. The family all slept in the attic loft of the one-room house. His paternal grandfather, also named Abner, had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. His maternal grandfather joined the army at 14 and was a mounted messenger for [[George Washington]]. His father, Ulysses F.

In 1858 he was transferred to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]] serving under Colonel [[John L. Gardner (brigadier general)|John L. Gardner]]. By the start of the Civil War, he was a [[Captain (United Staets O-3)|captain]] and second in command in the garrison at [[Fort Sumter]], under [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]].<ref name=Beckenbaugh/> He aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] bombardment on April 12, 1861.

He was appointed [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers on February 3, 1862, and was assigned to duty in northern Virginia while the Army of the Potomac conducted the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. His first combat assignment was to lead the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] of the [[Army of Virginia]] during the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. In the actions at Brawner\'s farm, just before the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], he took the initiative to send two of his regiments to reinforce Brigadier General [[John Gibbon]]\'s brigade against a larger Confederate force, fighting it to a standstill. (Personal initiative was required since his division commander, Brig. Gen. [[Rufus King (Civil War General)|Rufus King]], was incapacitated by an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure at the time. He was replaced by Brigadier General [[John P. Hatch]].)<ref>Langellier, pp. 43, 45, 49.</ref> His men were routed when they encountered Major General [[James Longstreet]]\'s corps, but by the following day, August 30, he took command of the division when Hatch was wounded, and he led his men to cover the retreat of the Union Army.<ref name=Tagg/>\n\nDoubleday again led the division, now assigned to the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] of the Army of the Potomac, after [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]], where Hatch was wounded again. At [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], he led his men into the deadly fighting in the Cornfield and the West Woods, and one colonel described him as a \"gallant officer ... remarkably cool and at the very front of battle.\"<ref name=Tagg/> He was wounded when an artillery shell exploded near his horse, throwing him to the ground in a violent fall. He received a brevet promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his actions at Antietam and was promoted in March 1863 to [[Major General#United States|major general]] of volunteers, to rank from November 29, 1862.<ref>Eicher, p. 703.</ref> At [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] in December 1862, his division mostly sat idle. During the winter, the I Corps was reorganized and Doubleday assumed command of the 3rd Division. At [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, the division was kept in reserve.<ref name=Tagg/>\n\n===Gettysburg===\n[[File:DoubledayBirthplace.jpg|thumb|Birthplace in Ballston Spa]]\n[[File:Doubleday and wife (1).jpg|thumb|right|Doubleday and his wife, Mary]]\nAt the start of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1, 1863, Doubleday\'s division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of Brigadier General [[John Buford]]. When his corps commander, Major General [[John F. Reynolds]], was killed very early in the fighting, Doubleday found himself in command of the corps at 10:50 am. His men fought well in the morning, putting up a stout resistance, but as overwhelming Confederate forces massed against them, their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] to the relative safety of [[Cemetery Hill]] south of town. It was Doubleday\'s finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. Seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent, indicating the ferocity of the Union defense. On Cemetery Hill, however, the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty, and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle; it would be decommissioned in March 1864, its surviving units consolidated into other corps.<ref name=Tagg/>\n\nOn July 2, 1863, Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] replaced Doubleday with Major General [[John Newton (engineer)|John Newton]], a more junior officer from another corps. The ostensible reason was a false report by [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] commander Major General [[Oliver O. Howard]] that Doubleday\'s corps broke first, causing the entire Union line to collapse, but Meade also had a long history of disdain for Doubleday\'s combat effectiveness, dating back to South Mountain. Doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against Meade, but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle.<ref name=Tagg/> He was wounded in the neck on the second day of Gettysburg and received a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service.<ref name=Eicher/> He formally requested reinstatement as I Corps commander, but Meade refused, and Doubleday left Gettysburg on July 7 for Washington.<ref>Coddington, pp. 690-91.</ref>\n\nDoubleday\'s indecision as a commander in the war resulted in his uncomplimentary nickname \"Forty-Eight Hours.\"<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n===Washington===\nDoubleday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of [[Washington, D.C.]], where he was in charge of courts martial, which gave him legal experience that he used after the war. His only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jubal A. Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Also while in Washington, Doubleday testified against George Meade at the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the Battle of Gettysburg.<ref name=Beckenbaugh/> While in Washington, Doubleday remained a loyal [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and staunch supporter of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Doubleday rode with Lincoln on the train to Gettysburg for the [[Gettysburg Address]] and Col. and Mrs. Doubleday attended events with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln in Washington.\n\n==Postbellum career==\nAfter the Civil War, Doubleday mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24, 1865, reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and became the colonel of the 35th U.S. Infantry in September 1867. He was stationed in [[San Francisco]] from 1869 through 1871 and he took out a patent for the [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] railway that still runs there, receiving a charter for its operation, but signing away his rights when he was reassigned. In 1871 he commanded the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th U.S. Infantry]], an all African-American regiment with headquarters at [[Fort McKavett]], [[Texas]].<ref name=TX/> He retired in 1873\n\nIn the 1870s, he was listed in the New York business directory as lawyer.\n\nDoubleday spent much of his time writing. He published two important works on the Civil War: \'\'Reminiscences of Forts Sumter and Moultrie\'\' (1876), and \'\'Chancellorsville and Gettysburg\'\' (1882), the latter being a volume of the series \'\'Campaigns of the Civil War\'\'.<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n==Theosophy==\nIn the summer of 1878 Doubleday lived in [[Mendham Township, New Jersey]], and became a prominent member of the [[Theosophical Society]]. When two of the founders of that society, [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], moved to India at the end of that year, he was constituted as the president of the American body. Another prominent member was [[Thomas A. Edison]].<ref>Gomes, [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/40-90-1/th-tsgom.htm Theosophy article]</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Doubleday\'s Tombstone.JPG|thumb|right|Doubleday\'s tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery]]\nDoubleday died of heart disease. Doubleday\'s body was laid in state in New York\'s City Hall and then was taken to Washington by train<ref name=Tagg/> from Mendham Township, and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Arlington, Virginia.<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n==Baseball==\n{{Main|Doubleday myth}}\n\nAlthough Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, he is more widely remembered as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball, in [[Elihu Phinney]]\'s cow pasture in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839.\n\nThe [[Mills Commission]], chaired by [[Abraham G. Mills]], the fourth president of the [[National League]], was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee\'s final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that \"the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.\" It concluded by saying, \"in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday\'s fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army.\"<ref>Kirsch, pp. xiii.</ref>\n\nHowever, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a \"myth\". He wrote, \"Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\" At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game, and his \'\'New York Times\'\' obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday\'s body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life.<ref name=Kirschxiiixiv/> Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.<ref>Morris, Peter. \'\'But Didn\'t We Have Fun\'\'. Ivan R. Dee Publishing. 2008</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of solid evidence linking Doubleday to the origins of baseball, Cooperstown, New York became the new home of what is today the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 1937.\n\nThere may have been some relationship to the baseball as a national sport, and Abner Doubleday.  While the modern rules of baseball were formulated in New York during the 1840s, it was the scattering of New Yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country, that spread not only baseball, but also the \"New York Rules\", thereby harmonizing the rules, and being a catalyst for its growth.  Doubleday was a high ranking officer, whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states.  For the morale of the men, he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the men.<ref>Bats,Balls, and Bullets Essay by George B. Kirsch Civil War Times Illustrated: May 1998 pages 30-37</ref>\n\n==Namesakes and honors==\nThere is a monument to Doubleday at Gettysburg erected by his men, admirers, and the state of New York. There is a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} obelisk monument at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] where he is buried, located about {{convert|130|ft|m}} behind the Lee Mansion. There was a movement to petition the [[United States Postmaster General|postmaster general]] to issue a U.S. postage stamp for him in 2011, commemorating the 150th anniversary of Fort Sumter. [[Doubleday Field]] is a [[minor league baseball]] [[stadium]] named for Abner Doubleday, located in [[Cooperstown, New York]], near the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]. It hosted the annual [[Doubleday Field#halloffamegame|Hall of Fame Game]], an [[exhibition game]] between two [[Major League Baseball|major league]] teams that was played from 1940 until 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-11-18-hall-of-fame-game_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Hall of Fame schedules replacement game for 2009 | date=November 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Auburn Doubledays]] are a [[minor league baseball]] team based in Doubleday\'s hometown of [[Auburn, New York]].\n\nDoubleday Field at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, where the [[Army Black Knights]] play at [[Johnson Stadium at Doubleday Field|Johnson Stadium]], is named in Doubleday\'s honor.\n\nThe Abner Doubleday Little League and Babe Ruth Fields in Ballston Spa, New York, the town of his birth.

In amplitude modulation, the [[amplitude]] (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted.  That waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a [[loudspeaker]], or the light intensity of television pixels.  This technique contrasts with [[frequency modulation]], in which the [[frequency]] of the [[carrier signal]] is varied, and [[phase modulation]], in which its [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is varied.\n\nAM was the earliest modulation method used to transmit voice by radio. It was developed during the first two decades of the 20th century beginning with Roberto Landell De Moura and [[Reginald Fessenden]]\'s [[radiotelephone]] experiments in 1900.<ref>http://www.aminharadio.com/radio/files/Artigo-Revista-PCP-USA.pdf</ref>  It remains in use today in many forms of communication; for example it is used in portable [[two way radio]]s, [[Airband|VHF aircraft radio]], [[Citizen\'s Band Radio]] and in computer [[modem]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} \"AM\" is often used to refer to [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]].\n\n[[File:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|right|250px|Fig 1: An audio signal (top) may be carried by a [[carrier signal]] using AM or FM methods.|alt=Animation of audio, AM and FM modulated carriers.]]\n\n==Forms of amplitude modulation==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}\nIn [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], [[modulation]] means varying some aspect of a higher frequency [[continuous wave]] [[carrier signal]] with an information-bearing modulation waveform, such as an [[audio signal]] which represents sound, or a [[video signal]] which represents images, so the carrier will \"carry\" the information.  When it reaches its destination, the information signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by [[demodulation]].\n\nIn amplitude modulation, the [[amplitude]] or \"strength\" of the carrier oscillations is what is varied.  For example, in AM radio communication, a [[continuous wave]] radio-frequency signal (a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[carrier wave]]) has its [[amplitude]] [[modulation|modulated]] by an audio waveform before transmission.     The audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the \'\'[[Envelope (waves)|envelope]]\'\' of the waveform. In the [[frequency domain]], amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the [[carrier frequency]] and two adjacent [[sideband]]s. Each sideband is equal in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to that of the modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other. Standard AM is thus sometimes called \"double-sideband amplitude modulation\" (DSB-AM) to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on AM.\n\nOne disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) is that the receiver amplifies and detects [[Noise (radio)|noise]] and [[electromagnetic interference]] in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received [[signal to noise ratio]], say, by a factor of 10 (a 10 [[decibel]] improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to  [[frequency modulation]] (FM) and [[digital radio]] where the effect of such noise following [[demodulation]] is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and [[high fidelity]] broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, [[talk radio]] etc.).\n\nAnother disadvantage of AM is that it is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal.  The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.).  However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using [[envelope detector|envelope detection]], providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands.  In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the [[intermediate frequency]]) from a greatly reduced \"pilot\" carrier (in [[reduced-carrier transmission]] or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]], carrier regeneration is possible using a [[Costas loop|Costas phase-locked loop]]. This doesn\'t work however for [[single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]] (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic \"Donald Duck\" sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in [[amateur radio]] and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]] broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.\n\nAn additional function provided by the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the [[automatic gain control]] (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is \'\'no\'\' transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called \'\'fast attack, slow decay\'\' circuit which holds the AGC level for a second or more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.\n\nA trivial form of AM which can be used for transmitting [[Digital data|binary data]] is [[on-off keying]], the simplest form of \'\'[[amplitude-shift keying]]\'\', in which [[Binary numeral system|ones and zeros]] are represented by the presence or absence of a carrier. On-off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit [[Morse code]] where it is known as [[continuous wave]] (CW) operation, even though the transmission is not strictly \"continuous.\"\n\n===ITU designations===\n\nIn 1982, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) designated the types of amplitude modulation:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Designation!!Description\n|-\n|A3E||[[double sideband|double-sideband]] a full-carrier - the basic Amplitude modulation scheme\n|-\n|R3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] [[Reduced-carrier transmission|reduced-carrier]]\n|-\n|H3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] full-carrier\n|-\n|J3E||[[Single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|single-sideband suppressed-carrier]]\n|-\n|B8E||[[independent sideband|independent-sideband]] emission\n|-\n|C3F||[[vestigal sideband|vestigial-sideband]]\n|-\n|Lincompex||linked [[compander|compressor and expander]]\n|}<!--single mid band linked modulation\n[B4E side bander inter linked] [expand carrier] full reduced.aLTIDOE-->\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Telefunken arc radiotelephone.jpg|thumb|One of the crude pre-vacuum tube AM transmitters, a Telefunken [[arc converter|arc transmitter]] from 1906.

The first radio transmitters, called [[spark gap transmitter]]s, transmitted information by [[wireless telegraphy]], using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in [[Morse code]].  They couldn\'t transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of [[damped wave]]s, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, that sounded like a buzz in receivers.  In effect they were already amplitude modulated.\n\n===Continuous waves===\nThe first AM transmission was made by Canadian researcher [[Reginald Fessenden]] on 23 December 1900 using a [[spark gap transmitter]] with a specially designed high frequency 10&nbsp;kHz [[induction coil|interrupter]], over a distance of 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km) at Cobb Island, Maryland, USA.   His first transmitted words were, \"Hello. One, two, three, four.  Is it snowing where you are, Mr. Thiessen?\".  The words were barely intelligible above the background buzz of the spark.\n\nFessenden was a significant figure in the development of AM radio.  He was one of the first researchers to realize, from experiments like the above, that the existing technology for producing radio waves, the spark transmitter, was not usable for amplitude modulation, and that a new kind of transmitter, one that produced [[sinusoidal]] \'\'[[continuous wave]]s\'\', was needed.  This was a radical idea at the time, because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves, and Fessenden was ridiculed.   He invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters - the [[Alexanderson alternator]], with which he made what is considered the first AM public entertainment broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1906.  He also discovered the principle on which AM modulation is based, [[heterodyne|heterodyning]], and invented one of the first [[detector (radio)|detector]]s able to [[rectifier|rectify]] and receive AM, the electrolytic detector or \"liquid baretter\", in 1902.  Other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy, such as the [[Fleming valve]] (1904) and the [[crystal detector]] (1906) also proved able to rectify AM signals, so the technological hurdle was generating AM waves; receiving them was not a problem.\n\n===Early technologies===\nEarly experiments in AM radio transmission, conducted by Fessenden, Valdamar Poulsen, Ernst Ruhmer, [[Quirino Majorana]], Charles Harrold, and [[Lee De Forest]], were hampered by the lack of a technology for [[amplifier|amplification]].  The first practical continuous wave AM [[transmitter]]s  were based on either the huge, expensive [[Alexanderson alternator]], developed 1906-1910, or versions of the [[Poulsen arc]] transmitter (arc converter), invented in 1903.  The modifications necessary to transmit AM were clumsy and resulted in  very low quality audio.  Modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon [[microphone]] inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire; its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna.  The limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones; many of the microphones were water-cooled.\n\n===Vacuum tubes===\nThe discovery in 1912 of the amplifying ability of the [[Audion]] [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1906 by [[Lee De Forest]], solved these problems.  The vacuum tube [[electronic oscillator|feedback oscillator]], invented in 1912 by [[Edwin Armstrong]] and [[Alexander Meissner]], was a cheap source of [[continuous wave]]s and could be easily [[modulation|modulated]] to make an AM transmitter.  Modulation did not have to be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube, so the microphone or other audio source didn\'t have to handle high power.  Wartime research greatly advanced the art of AM modulation, and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music.  The vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]] around 1920, the first electronic [[mass communication|mass entertainment]] medium.  Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for [[radio broadcasting]] until [[FM broadcasting]] began after World War 2.\n\nAt the same time as AM radio began, [[telephone company|telephone companies]] such as [[AT&T]] were developing the other large application for AM: sending multiple telephone calls through a single wire by modulating them on separate [[carrier signal|carrier]] frequencies, called \'\'[[frequency division multiplexing]]\'\'.<ref name=\"Bray\" />\n\n===Single-sideband===\nJohn Renshaw Carson in 1915 did the first mathematical analysis of amplitude modulation, showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency, and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal.<ref name=\"Bray\" />  His analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal, and Carson patented [[single-sideband modulation]] (SSB) on 1 December 1915.<ref name=\"Bray\" /> This more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by AT&T for [[longwave]] transatlantic telephone service beginning 7 January 1927.  After WW2 it was developed by the military for aircraft communication.\n\n==Simplified analysis of standard AM==\n[[File:Illustration of Amplitude Modulation.png|thumb|391x391px|Illustration of Amplitude Modulation]]\nConsider a carrier wave (sine wave) of frequency \'\'f<sub>c</sub>\'\' and amplitude \'\'A\'\' given by:\n\n:<math>c(t) = A\\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi f_c t)\\,</math>.\n\nLet \'\'m\'\'(\'\'t\'\') represent the modulation waveform. For this example we shall take the modulation to be simply a sine wave of a frequency \'\'f<sub>m</sub>\'\', a much lower frequency (such as an audio frequency) than \'\'f<sub>c</sub>\'\':\n\n:<math>m(t) = M\\cdot \\cos(2 \\pi f_m t + \\phi)\\,</math>,\n\nwhere \'\'M\'\' is the amplitude of the modulation. We shall insist that \'\'M\'\'<1 so that \'\'(1+m(t))\'\' is always positive. If \'\'M\'\'>1 then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal. Amplitude modulation results when the carrier \'\'c(t)\'\' is multiplied by the positive quantity  \'\'(1+m(t))\'\':\n\n:{|\n|<math>y(t)\\,</math>\n|<math>= [1 + m(t)]\\cdot c(t) \\,</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= [1 + M\\cdot \\cos(2 \\pi f_m t + \\phi)] \\cdot A \\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi f_c t)</math>\n|}\n\nIn this simple case \'\'M\'\' is identical to the [[#Modulation index|modulation index]], discussed below. With \'\'M\'\'=0.5 the amplitude modulated signal \'\'y\'\'(\'\'t\'\') thus corresponds to the top graph (labelled \"50% Modulation\") in Figure 4.\n\nUsing [[Prosthaphaeresis#The identities|prosthaphaeresis identities]], \'\'y\'\'(\'\'t\'\') can be shown to be the sum of three sine waves:\n\n:<math>y(t) = A\\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi f_c t) + \\begin{matrix}\\frac{AM}{2} \\end{matrix} \\left[\\sin(2 \\pi (f_c + f_m) t + \\phi) + \\sin(2 \\pi (f_c - f_m) t - \\phi)\\right].\\,</math>\n\nTherefore, the modulated signal has three components: the carrier wave \'\'c(t)\'\' which is unchanged, and two pure sine waves (known as [[sideband]]s) with frequencies slightly above and below the carrier frequency \'\'f<sub>c</sub>\'\'.\n\n==Spectrum==\n[[File:AM spectrum.svg|thumb|400px|Fig 2: Double-sided spectra of baseband and AM signals.|alt=Diagrams of an AM signal, with formulas]]\nOf course a useful modulation signal \'\'m(t)\'\' will generally not consist of a single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of [[Fourier decomposition]], \'\'m(t)\'\' can be expressed as the sum of a number of sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of  \'\'1+m(t)\'\' with \'\'c(t)\'\' as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier \'\'c(t)\'\' is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of \'\'m\'\' at \'\'f<sub>i</sub>\'\' there are two sidebands at frequencies \'\'f<sub>c</sub> + f<sub>i</sub>\'\' and  \'\'f<sub>c</sub> - f<sub>i</sub>\'\'. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation \'\'m(t)\'\' to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal [[Fourier transform]] of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation \'\'m(t)\'\' having simply been shifted in frequency by \'\'f<sub>c</sub>\'\' as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).\n\n[[File:AM signal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fig 3: The [[spectrogram]] of an AM voice broadcast shows the two sidebands (green) on either side of the carrier (red) with time proceeding in the vertical direction.|alt=Sonogram of an AM signal, showing the carrier and both sidebands vertically]]\nIf we just look at the short-term spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted \'\'above\'\' the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.\n\n==Power and spectrum efficiency==\nThe RF bandwidth of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, but only considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or \"[[baseband]]\") signal, since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using [[frequency modulation]] (FM), it is twice as wide as [[single-sideband]] techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or \"channels\") can thus be accommodated. For this reason television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as [[vestigial sideband]], somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) in order to reduce the required channel spacing.\n\nAnother improvement over standard AM is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus there is a great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband ([[single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]]) or with both sidebands remaining ([[double sideband suppressed carrier]]). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing [[Product detector|synchronous detection]] and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using [[envelope detector|envelope detection]]. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.\n\n==Modulation index==\nThe AM modulation index is a measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the RF signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier. It is thus defined as:\n:<math>h = \\frac{\\mathrm{peak\\ value\\ of\\ } m(t)}{A} = \\frac{M}{A}  </math> \nwhere <math>M\\,</math> and <math>A\\,</math> are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude, respectively; the modulation amplitude is the peak (positive or negative) change in the RF amplitude from its unmodulated value. Modulation index is normally expressed as a percentage, and may be displayed on a meter connected to an AM transmitter.\n\nSo if <math>h=0.5</math>, carrier amplitude varies by 50% above (and below) its unmodulated level, as is shown in the first waveform, below. For <math>h=1.0</math>, it varies by 100% as shown in the illustration below it. With 100% modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero, and this represents full modulation using standard AM and is often a target (in order to obtain the highest possible [[signal to noise ratio]]) but mustn\'t be exceeded. Increasing the modulating signal beyond that point, known as [[overmodulation]], causes a standard AM modulator (see below) to fail, as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero, resulting in [[distortion]] (\"clipping\") of the received modulation. Transmitters typically incorporate a [[limiter]] circuit to avoid overmodulation, and/or  a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] circuit (especially for voice communications) in order to still approach 100% modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise. Such circuits are sometimes referred to as a [[vogad]].\n\nHowever it is possible to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of [[double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission]]. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power [[broadcast]] transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a [[linear amplifier]]. What\'s more, a standard AM receiver using an [[envelope detector]] is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally \'\'not\'\' referred to as \"AM\" even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]] where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term \"modulation index\" loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.\n\n[[File:Amplitude Modulated Wave-hm-64.svg|thumb|400px|center|Fig 4: Modulation depth.

Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally.\n\nHe is perhaps best known as the [[inventor]] of the [[Fresnel lens]], first adopted in [[lighthouse]]s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today.  His [[Fresnel equations]] on waves and [[reflectivity]] also form the basis for many applications in [[computer graphics]] today - for instance, the rendering of [[water]].\n\n==Personal life and education==\nFresnel was the  \nson of an architect, born at [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] ([[Eure]]). His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when he was eight years old. At thirteen he entered the ?cole Centrale in [[Caen]], and at sixteen and a half the [[?cole Polytechnique]], where he acquitted himself with distinction. From there he went to the [[?cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss?es|?cole des Ponts et Chauss?es]].\n\nHe received only scant public recognition during his lifetime for his labours in the cause of optical science. Some of his papers were not printed by the [[Acad?mie des Sciences]] until many years after his death. But as he wrote to Young in 1824: in himself \"that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory\" had been blunted. \"All the compliments,\" he says, \"that I have received from [[Fran?ois Arago|Arago]], [[Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFresnel has been described as a man with interest in religious questions and deep faith in God.<ref>Graves, Dan. 1996. \'\'Scientists of Faith: Forty-eight Biographies of Historic Scientists and Their Christian Faith\'\'.

In 1815, on the second restoration of the monarchy, he obtained a post as engineer in [[Paris]].\n\nIn 1818 he wrote a memoir on [[diffraction]], for which he received the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Acad?mie des Sciences]] at Paris the following year. He was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a [[Fresnel lens]], as a substitute for mirrors in lighthouses. In 1819, he was nominated to be a commissioner of lighthouses.  In 1823 he was unanimously elected a member of the academy. In 1825 he became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]].  In 1827, the time of his last illness, the Royal Society of London awarded him the [[Rumford Medal]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1818 he published his Memoir on the Diffraction of Light, submitted to the Academe of science in 1818.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fresnel|first=Augustin|year=1819|chapter=Memoir on the Diffraction of Light|title=The Wave Theory of Light ?

He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as a [[Fresnel rhomb]], having obtuse angles of 126? and acute angles of 54?. The [[Fresnel?Arago laws]] are three laws which summarise some of the more important properties of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between light of different states of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].

When light moves from a medium of a given [[refractive index]] \'\'n\'\'<sub>1</sub> into a second medium with refractive index \'\'n\'\'<sub>2</sub>, both [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of the light may occur.\n\nThe [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation is an approximation of [[Kirchhoff\'s diffraction formula|Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction]] that can be applied to the propagation of waves in the [[near and far field|near field]].<ref>[[Max Born|M.

Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint [[John Cassian]] speaks of an abbot of the [[Thebaid]] who had 500 monks under him. By the [[Rule of St Benedict]], which, until the [[Cluniac reforms]], was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluniac]] Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nMonks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the [[sacraments]], and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the [[ordination]] of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become [[deacon]]s, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the [[first Council of Constantinople]], AD 448, 23 [[archimandrite]]s or abbots sign, with 30 [[bishop]]s.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe [[second Council of Nicaea]], AD 787, recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders{{sfn|Venables|1911}} below the [[deacon|diaconate]], a power usually reserved to bishops.\n\nAbbots were originally subject to [[bishop|episcopal]] jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The [[Code of Justinian]] (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an \'\'imperium in imperio,\'\' and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his [[diocese]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\n{{main|Mitre#Christian clergy|l1=Mitres}}\nIn the 12th century, the abbots of [[Fulda monastery|Fulda]] claimed precedence of the [[archdiocese of Cologne|archbishop of Cologne]]. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of [[mitre]], ring, gloves and sandals.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nIt has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, \'\'Liturgische Gewandung\'\', p.&nbsp;453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], [[St Albans Abbey|St Alban\'s]], [[Bardney Abbey|Bardney]], [[Battle Abbey|Battle]], [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St Edmunds]], [[St Augustine\'s Abbey|St Augustine\'s Canterbury]], [[Colchester Abbey|Colchester]], [[Crowland Abbey|Croyland]], [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], [[Gloucester Abbey|Gloucester]], [[St Benet\'s Abbey|St Benet\'s Hulme]], [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde]], [[Malmesbury Abbey|Malmesbury]], [[Peterborough Abbey|Peterborough]], [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey]], [[Reading Abbey|Reading]], [[Selby Abbey|Selby]], [[Shrewsbury Abbey|Shrewsbury]], [[Tavistock Abbey|Tavistock]], [[Thorney Abbey|Thorney]], [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], [[Winchcombe Abbey|Winchcombe]], and [[St Mary\'s Abbey, York|St Mary\'s York]].<ref>[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-03.htm#ecclmap Government in Church and State] from \'\'University of Wisconsin-Madison\'\' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref> Of these the precedence was originally yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban\'s, in which monastery he had been brought up.

In the East abbots, if in priests\' orders and with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|second Nicene council]], AD 787, to confer the [[tonsure]] and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD 1489 permitted by [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate.  Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the [[canon law]].  One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot\'s orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}<!-- but paragraph lower down in EB1911-->\n\n====Appointments====\nWhen a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the [[abbey|convent]], but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In [[abbey]]s exempt from the (arch)bishop\'s diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and [[benediction]] had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot\'s journey to [[Rome]]. It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years,<ref name=EB/> unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontr? and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8?12 years.<ref name=EB/>\n\nThe ceremony of the formal admission of a [[Benedictine]] abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the [[Consuetudinary (book)|consuetudinary]] of Abingdon.  The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession.  After proceeding up the [[nave]], he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his [[commissary]], and placed in his stall.  The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his [[staff of office]].  He then put on his shoes in the [[vestry]], and a [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n==General information==\nBefore the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house.  When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed.  His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king.  No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society.  The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table.  In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks.  In the West the [[Rule of St Benedict]] appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers.  Because this permission opened the door to luxurious living, [[Synods of Aachen (816?819)]], decreed that the abbot should dine in the [[refectory]], and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots.  When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his [[chaplain]]s waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n[[File:Template-Abbot - Provost.svg|right|thumb|Arms of a Roman Catholic abbot are distinguished by a gold [[crozier]] with a veil attached and a black [[galero]] with twelve tassels (the galero of a [[territorial abbot]] would be green)]]\nThe ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire.  Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]].  Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of [[Leicester]], c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting.  In magnificence of equipage and [[retinue]] the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm.  They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants.  The bells of the churches were rung as they passed.  They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}  This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially.  For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], judicially murdered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons.  The [[abbots of Cluny]] and [[Trinity Abbey, Vend?me|Vend?me]] were, by virtue of their office, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s of the Roman church.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nIn the process of time, the title abbot was extended to [[clergy#Catholic clergy|clerics]] who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and under the [[Charlemagne|Carolingians]] to the chief chaplain of the king, \'\'{{lang|la|Abbas Curiae}}\'\', or military chaplain of the emperor, \'\'{{lang|la|Abbas Castrensis.}}\'\' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials.  Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at [[Genoa]] was called \'\'{{lang|la|Abbas Populi}}\'\'.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n[[Lay abbot]]s (M. Lat. \'\'{{lang|la|defensores}}\'\', \'\'{{lang|la|abbacomites}}\'\', \'\'{{lang|la|abbates laici}}\'\', \'\'{{lang|la|abbates milites}}\'\', \'\'{{lang|la|abbates saeculares}}\'\' or \'\'{{lang|la|irreligiosi}}\'\', \'\'{{lang|la|abbatiarii}}\'\', or sometimes simply \'\'{{lang|la|abbates}}\'\') were the outcome of the growth of the [[Feudalism|feudal]] system from the 8th century onwards.  The practice of [[commendation]], by which?to meet a contemporary emergency?the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,\nearly suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held \'\'in [[commendam]].\'\'{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nDuring the Carolingian epoch, the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable [[fiefdom|fiefs]] or [[benefice]]s, and by the 10th century, before the great [[Cluniac]] reform, the system was firmly established. Even the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey of St Denis]] was held in commendam by [[Hugh Capet]]. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever.  In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the [[council of Cloveshoe]].  These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions.  The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other.  The [[enfeoffment]] of abbeys differed in form and degree.  Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as [[dean (religion)|dean]] (decanus), but also as abbot (\'\'abbas legitimas\'\', \'\'monasticus\'\', \'\'regularis\'\').{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nWhen the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, the actual head of the community retaining that of dean.  The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West.  John, [[patriarch of Antioch]], at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, \'\'bencficiarii,\'\' for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n[[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported (\'\'Itinerary\'\', ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:\n:\"for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.\"\n\nIn conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a [[prior]].\n\n==Modern practices==\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the [[Carthusians]] for instance, have no abbots, only [[prior]]s). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the Pope,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability?a certain number of monks in vows, a certain number of years of establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.\n\n[[File:Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi.jpg|thumb|Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi (on the left) of [[Monastery of the Holy Spirit]], a [[Trappist]] monastery in Conyers, Georgia, USA.]]\nThe abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks. Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the [[mitre]], the ring, and the [[crosier]] as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of Holy Orders (although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy).\n\nOnce he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of \"exempt religious\" in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the Pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.\n\nThe abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.\n\n[[Territorial abbot]]s follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the Pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.\n\n==Abbatial hierarchy==\nIn some monastic families, there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots. In some cases, this is the result of an abbey being considered the \"mother\" of several \"daughter\" abbeys founded originally as dependent priories of the \"mother.\" In other cases, abbeys have affiliated in networks known as \"congregations.\" Some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order.\n\n* The abbot of [[Sant\'Anselmo]] di Aventino, in Rome, is styled the \"abbot primate,\" and is acknowledged the senior abbot for the Order of St. Benedict (O.S.B.)\n* An abbot president is the head of a congregation (federation) of abbeys within the Order of St. Benedict (for instance, the English Congregation, The American Cassinese Congregation, etc.), or of the Cistercians (O. Cist.)\n* An archabbot is the head of some monasteries which are the motherhouses of other monasteries (for instance, [[Saint Vincent Archabbey]], [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]])\n\n==Modern abbots not as superior==\nThe title [[abb?]] (French; Ital. \'\'abate\'\'), as commonly used in the Catholic Church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English \"Father\" (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the [[tonsure]].  This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the [[concordat]] between [[Pope Leo X]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1516), to appoint \'\'abb?s commendataires\'\' to most of the abbeys in France.  The expectation of obtaining these [[sinecure]]s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abb?s so formed?\'\'abb?s de cour\'\' they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) \'\'abb?s de sainte esp?rance\'\', (abb?s of holy hope; or the pun, of St. Hope)?came to hold a recognized position.  The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the title of abb?, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising [[celibacy]] and wearing a distinctive dress?a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar.  Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abb?. The class did not survive the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]; but the [[courtesy title]] of abb?, having long lost all connection in people\'s minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman.\n\n==Eastern Christian==\n{{further|Hegumen|Archimandrite}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the abbot is referred to as the \'\'[[hegumen]]\'\'. The Superior of a convent of nuns is called the \'\'H?gum?n?\'\'. The title of \'\'[[archimandrite]]\'\' (literally the head of the enclosure) used to mean something similar.\n\nIn the East, the principle set forth in the \'\'[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]\'\' still applies, whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop. Those monasteries which enjoy the status of being \'\'stauropegiac\'\' will be subject only to a [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] or his [[Synod]] of Bishops and not the local bishop.\n\n==Honorary and other uses of the title==\nThough the title \"abbot\" is not given in the Western Church to any but actual abbots of monasteries today, the title archimandrite is given to \"monastics\" (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of [[monsignor]] in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the [[Orthodox Church]], only actual monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of [[Archpriest]] or [[Protopresbyter]]. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been [[widow]]ed. Since the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who actually serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.\n\nIn the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|German Evangelical Church]], the German title of \'\'Abt\'\' (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French \'\'abb?\'\', as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.\nOf these the most noteworthy is [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Hanover]], founded as a [[Cistercian]] house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Loccum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence over all the clergy of Hanover, and was \'\'ex officio\'\' a member of the [[wiktionary:consistory|consistory]] of the kingdom.  The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the \"convent\" of \'\'[[Stiftsherr]]en\'\' (canons).\n\nIn the [[Church of England]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], by royal decree given by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], also holds the honorary title of \"Abbot of St. Benet.\"  This title hails back to England\'s separation from the See of Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monasteries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benet, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth, and lived like simple beggars, deposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.\n\nAdditionally, at the [[enthronement]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], there is a threefold enthronement, once in the throne the chancel as the [[diocesan bishop]] of [[Canterbury]], once in the [[Chair of St. Augustine]] as the [[Primate of All England]], and then once in the chapter-house as Titular Abbot of Canterbury.\n\nThere are several Benedictine Abbeys throughout the [[Anglican Communion]]. Most of them have mitred abbots.\n\n==Abbots in art and literature==\n[[File:Houghton Typ 515.38.456a - Totentanz, 14.jpg|thumb|\"The Abbot\", from the \'\'[[Dance of Death]]\'\', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\n\"The Abbot\" is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of [[Dance Macabre]].\n\nThe lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to Christian [[hagiography]], one of the most well-known being the \'\'Life of St. [[Benedict of Nursia]]\'\' by St. [[Gregory the Great]].\n\nDuring the years 1106?1107 A.D., a Russian Orthodox abbot named Daniel made a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]] and recorded his experiences. His diary was much-read throughout Russia, and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive.\n\n[[Joseph of Volokolamsk|Saint Joseph]], Abbot of [[Volokolamsk]] (1439?1515), wrote a number of influential works against [[heresy]], and about monastic and liturgical discipline, and Christian [[philanthropy]].\n\nIn the Tales of Redwall series, the creatures of Redwall are led by an Abbot or Abbess. These \"abbots\" are appointed by the brothers and sisters of Redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care, much like real abbots.\n\n\"The Abbot\" was a nickname of [[RZA]] from the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abb?]]\n*[[Abb?

The size of the upper [[canine tooth]] in \'\'A. ramidus\'\' males was not distinctly different from that of females.

In particular, it has been used to suggest that the [[last common ancestor]] of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition \"compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition.\"<ref name=\"Suwa_2009b\"/>\n\n\'\'A. ramidus\'\' existed more recently than the [[most recent common ancestor]] of humans and chimpanzees ([[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|CLCA or \'\'Pan\'\'-\'\'Homo\'\' LCA]]) and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; \'\'A. ramidus\'\' feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of \'\'A. ramidus\'\' are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. \"Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools,\" the research team concluded.<ref name=\"AndThePaleobiology\" />\n\n=== Ardi ===\n{{Main|Ardi}}\nOn October 1, [[2009 in science|2009]], paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete \'\'A. ramidus\'\' fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994.

Consequently, it is argued the species represents a unique ontogeny unlike any extant ape. The reduced growth in the sub-nasal alveolar region of the face, which houses the projecting canine complex in chimpanzees, suggests the species had rates of growth and reproductive biology unlike any living primate species. In this sense the species may show the first trend towards human social, parenting and sexual psychology. Consequently, the authors argue it is no longer tenable to extrapolate from chimpanzees in reconstructions of early hominin social and mating behaviour, providing further evidence against the so-called \'chimpanzee referential model\'.<ref>Sayers, K et al. \'Human Evolution and the Chimpanzee referential Model\' \'\'Annual Review of Anthropology\'\', Vol. 41: 119-138.</ref>  As the authors write when discussing the species unusual pattern of cranio-dental growth and the light it may throw on the origins of human sociality:\n\n\'The contrast [of humans] with chimpanzees is instructive, for when humans start developing broader social bonds after the permanent dentition begins erupting, at the same developmental milestone, chimpanzee facial projection increases. In other words, humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio-emotional development. As \'\'A. ramidus\'\' no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of a prognathic jaw with a C/P3 complex (which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species), young and sub-adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group. The implication of these interspecific differences is that \'\'A. ramidus\'\' would have most likely had a period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees. Consequently, it is possible that in \'\'A.ramidus\'\' we see the first, albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisation\'.<ref>Clark, G.; Henneberg, M. pp126-7.</ref>\n\nIt should be noted that this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of \'\'A.ramidus\'\'. The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould\'s theory in [[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|\'\'Ontogeny and Phylogeny\'\']] that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ardi]]\n*[[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor]]\n*[[Lucy (Australopithecus)]], 3.2 million years extinct hominin\n* [[List of human evolution fossils]] \'\'(with images)\'\'\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikispecies}}\n{{Commons category|Ardipithecus}}\n*[http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/ Science Magazine: \'\'Ardipithecus\'\' special] (requires free registration)\n* The Smithsonian Institution\'s Human Origins Program:\n**[http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/ardipithecus-kadabba Ardipithecus kadabba]\n**[http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/ardipithecus-ramidus Ardipithecus ramidus]\n*[http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/ardipithecusramidus.htm \'\'Ardipithecus ramidus\'\'] at Archaeology info\n*[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/human-evolution/human-ancestor \'\'Explore Ardipithecus\'\'] at [[National Geographic Magazine|NationalGeographic.com]]\n*[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/64.full?sid=0e89e15f-0594-40ef-9dce-2b9b9f48d9e6  \'\'Ardipithecus ramidus\'\' - Science Journal Article]\n*[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/ardipithecus/ardipithecus.html Discovering Ardi - Discovery Channel]\n\n{{Human Evolution}}\n{{Breakthrough of the Year}}\n\n[[Category:Hominini]]\n[[Category:Pliocene primates]]\n[[Category:Transitional fossils]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1995]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Zanclean extinctions]]'

By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly.\n\nAssembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as [[automobile]]s and other [[transportation]] equipment, [[household]] appliances and [[Consumer electronics|electronic goods]].\n\n==Concept==\n[[File:Final assembly 3.jpg|thumb|[[Lotus Cars]] assembly line as of 2008]]\nAssembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of [[worker]]s, [[tool]]s or machines, and parts.  The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by [[conveyor]]s or motorized vehicles such as [[fork lifts]], or [[gravity]], with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as [[overhead crane]]s or fork lifts. Each worker typically performs one simple operation.\n\nAccording to [[Henry Ford]]:\n\n{{quote|The principles of assembly are these:\n\n:(1) Place the tools and the men in the sequence of the operation so that each component part shall travel the least possible distance while in the process of finishing.\n\n:(2) Use work slides or some other form of carrier so that when a workman completes his operation, he drops the part always in the same place?which place must always be the most convenient place to his hand?and if possible have gravity carry the part to the next workman for his own.\n\n:(3) Use sliding assembling lines by which the parts to be assembled are delivered at convenient distances.<ref name=\"Ford1922\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, p. 45 (on line version), p. 80 (print version)</ref>}}\n\n==Simple example==\n\nConsider the assembly of a [[car]]: assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine, install the hood, and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); only one of these steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If [[engine]] installation takes 20 minutes, [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] installation takes five minutes, and [[wheel]]s installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.\n\nIn an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When one station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time, each one at a different stage of its assembly.\n\nAfter finishing its work on the first car, the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car. While the engine installation crew works on the second car, the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood, then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels. After the engine has been installed on the second car, the second car moves to the hood assembly. At the same time, the third car moves to the engine assembly. When the third car?s engine has been mounted, it then can be moved to the hood station; meanwhile, subsequent cars (if any) can be moved to the engine installation station.\n\nAssuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another, the longest stage on the assembly line determines the [[throughput (business)|throughput]] (20 minutes for the engine installation) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes, once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced.\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[Industrial Revolution]], most manufactured products were made individually by hand. A single [[Artisan|craftsman]] or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product. They would use their skills and tools such as [[File (tool)|files]] and [[knives]] to create the individual parts. They would then assemble them into the final product, making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together ([[craft production]]).\n\n[[Division of labor]] was practiced in China where state run monopolies [[mass-produced]] metal agricultural implements, china and armor and weapons centuries before it appeared in Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Merson|1990||p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>  [[Adam Smith]] discussed the [[division of labour]] in the manufacture of [[pins]] at length in his book \'\'[[The Wealth of Nations]]\'\' (published in 1776).\n\nThe [[Venetian Arsenal]], dating to about 1104, operated similar to a production line.  Ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed.  At the peak of its [[efficiency]] in the early 16th century, the [[Venetian Arsenal]] employed some 16,000 people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built [[galley]] with standardized parts on an assembly-line basis.  Although the Venice Arsenal lasted until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], production line methods did not become common even then.\n\n===Industrial revolution===\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention. Many industries, notably [[textile]]s, [[firearm]]s, [[clockmaking|clocks and watches]],<ref name = \"xovodv\">[[G.N. Georgano]] 1985.{{full|date=December 2014}}</ref> [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[Locomotive|railway locomotive]]s, [[sewing machine]]s, and [[bicycle]]s, saw expeditious improvement in materials handling, machining, and assembly during the 19th century, although modern concepts such as [[industrial engineering]] and [[logistics]] had not yet been named.\n\n[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Pulley#Block and tackle|pulley block]] was the first manufacture to become fully automated at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in the early 19th century.]]\n\nThe automatic [[flour]] [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] built by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785 was called the beginning of modern [[bulk material handling]] by Roe (1916). Evans\'s mill used a leather belt bucket elevator, [[screw conveyor]]s, canvas belt conveyors, and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour.  The innovation spread to other mills and breweries.<ref>{{harvnb|Roe|1916|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nProbably the earliest industrial example of a linear and continuous assembly process is the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], built between 1801 and 1803. [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] (father of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]), with the help of [[Henry Maudslay]] and others, designed 22 types of machine tools to make the parts for the rigging [[Block (sailing)|blocks]] used by the [[Royal Navy]]. This factory was so successful that it remained in use until the 1960s, with the workshop still visible at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Dockyard]] in [[Portsmouth]], and still containing some of the original machinery.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of an almost modern factory layout, designed for easy material handling, was the [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]].  The factory grounds were bordered by the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings. [[Crane (machine)|Crane]]s were used for lifting the heavy work, which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons.  The work passed sequentially through to erection of framework and final assembly.<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|Robinson|1969|pp=491?5}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bridgewater foundary.gif|thumb|left|The [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]], pictured in 1839, one of the earliest factories to use an almost modern [[Process layout|layout]], workflow, and material-handling system.]]\n\nThe first flow assembly line was initiated at the factory of [[Richard Garrett & Sons]], Leiston Works in [[Leiston]] in the [[English county]] of [[Suffolk]] for the manufacture of [[portable steam engine]]s. The assembly line area was called \'[[Long Shop Museum|The Long Shop]]\' on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853. The [[boiler]] was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line, and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. From the upper level, where other parts were made, the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be completed.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.industriouseast.org.uk/index.php?pageId=147&anchor=164&filter=gb |title= Long Shop Museum |accessdate= 2012-12-17}}{{full|date= December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Interchangeable parts===\n\nDuring the early 19th century, the development of [[machine tool]]s such as the [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]], and [[milling machine]], and of toolpath control via [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making [[interchangeable parts]] a practical reality.\n\n===Late 19th century steam and electric conveyors===\n\nSteam powered [[conveyor lift]]s began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Wells1890\">{{harvnb|Wells|1890|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> Hounshell (1984) shows a {{circa|1885}} sketch of an electric powered conveyor moving cans through a filling line in a canning factory.\n\nThe [[meatpacking]] industry of [[Chicago]] is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines (or dis-assembly lines) to be utilized in the United States starting in 1867. Workers would stand at fixed stations and a pulley system would bring the meat to each worker and they would complete one task. Henry Ford and others have written about the influence of this [[slaughterhouse]] practice on the later developments at Ford Motor Company.\n\n===20th century===\n\n[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|right|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913.

Domm, the modern assembly line and its basic concept is credited to [[Ransom Olds]], who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]].<ref name=\"michigan yesterday\">{{harvnb|Domm|2009|p=29}}</ref> Olds [[patented]] the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his [[Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] factory in 1901.<ref>{{cite web |first= Phil |last= Ament |url= http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/assbline.htm |title= Assembly Line History: Invention of the Assembly Line |publisher= Ideafinder.com |accessdate= 2011-10-15}}</ref> This development is often overshadowed by [[Henry Ford]], who perfected the assembly line by installing driven [[conveyor belts]] that could produce a [[Model T]] in 93 minutes.<ref name=\"michigan yesterday\"/>\n\nThe assembly line developed for the [[Ford Model T]] began operation on December 1, 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fords-assembly-line-starts-rolling |title= Ford\'s assembly line starts rolling |work= This Day in History |publisher= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> It had immense influence on the world.\n\nThe basic kernel of an assembly line concept was introduced to [[Ford Motor Company]] by William \"Pa\" Klann upon his return from visiting [[Gustavus Franklin Swift|Swift & Company\'s slaughterhouse]] in Chicago and viewing what was referred to as the \"disassembly line\", where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor. The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over caught his attention. He reported the idea to [[Peter E. Martin]], soon to be head of Ford production, who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed. Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to [[Henry Ford]], but Pa Klann\'s slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum<ref>{{cite document |last= Klann |first= W. C. |date= n.d. |title= Reminiscences |id= Accession 65 |publisher= Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village Archives}}</ref> and elsewhere, making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept. The process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of [[Peter E. Martin]], the factory superintendent; [[Charles E. Sorensen]], Martin\'s assistant; [[C. Harold Wills]], draftsman and toolmaker; [[Clarence W. Avery]]; [[Charles Ebender]]; and [[J?zsef Galamb]]. Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of [[machine tool]] placement that [[Walter Flanders]] had been doing at Ford up to 1908.\n\nIn 1922 Ford (through his ghostwriter Crowther) said of his 1913 assembly line:\n\n{{quote|I believe that this was the first moving line ever installed. The idea came in a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.<ref>{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p= 81}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Charles E. Sorensen]], in his 1956 memoir \'\'My Forty Years with Ford\'\', presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual ?inventors? as a gradual, logical development of [[industrial engineering]]:\n\n{{quote|What was worked out at Ford was the practice of moving the work from one worker to another until it became a complete unit, then arranging the flow of these units at the right time and the right place to a moving final assembly line from which came a finished product. Regardless of earlier uses of some of these principles, the direct line of succession of mass production and its intensification into automation stems directly from what we worked out at Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1913. Henry Ford is generally regarded as the father of mass production. He was not. He was the sponsor of it.<ref>{{harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=116}}.</ref>}}\n\nAs a result of these developments in method, Ford\'s cars came off the line in three-minute intervals. This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/> It was so successful, [[paint]] became a bottleneck. Only [[japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society.  Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class.  In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575.  This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months\' pay.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nFord\'s complex safety procedures?especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about?dramatically reduced the rate of [[injury]]. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"[[Fordism]]\", and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nFord at one point considered suing other car companies because they used the assembly line in their production, but decided against it, realizing it was essential to creation and expansion of the industry as a whole. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn the [[automotive industry]], its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1919, Vulcan (Southport, Lancashire) was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe massive demand for military hardware in World War II prompted assembly-line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production. Thousands of [[Liberty Ship]]s were built making extensive use of prefabrication, enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days. After having produced fewer than 3,000 planes for the United States Military in 1939, American aircraft manufacturers built over 300,000 planes in World War II. [[Vultee]] pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing. Other companies quickly followed. As William S. Knudsen of the National Defense Advisory Commission observed, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Herman|2012|pp=176?91}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parker|2012|pp=5?12}}</ref>\n\n==Improved working conditions==\nIn his 1922 autobiography,<ref name=\"Ford1922\"/> Henry Ford mentions several benefits of the assembly line including:\n\n*Workers do no heavy lifting.\n*No stooping or bending over.\n*No special training required.\n*There are jobs that almost anyone can do.\n*Provided employment to immigrants.\n\nThe gains in [[productivity]] allowed Ford to increase worker pay from $1.50 per day to $5.00 per day once employees reached three years of service on the assembly line. Ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the Model T price.  These goals appear altruistic; however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that ?every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963? in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.<ref>{{cite web |last= Crawford |first= Matthew |title= Shop Class as Soulcraft |url= http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |work= [[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]] }}</ref>\n\n==Sociological problems==\n[[Sociology|Sociological]] work has explored the [[social alienation]] and [[boredom]] that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 4105309 |title= Alienation and Freedom: The Factory Worker and His Industry |authorlink= Bob Blauner |first= Robert |last= Blauner |journal= [[Technology and Culture]] |volume= 6 |issue= 3 |date= Summer 1965 |pages= 518?519}}</ref> \n\nOne of Capitalism\'s most famous critics: [[Karl Marx]] highlighted in the \'\'Entfremdung\'\' theory the fact that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they\'ve created, products should be \"mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature.\" Marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalize facets of our personality. They argue that specialization makes it incredibly difficult for any worker to achieve a sense of genuine contribution they may be making to the real needs of humanity. The repetitive nature of specialized tasks causes, they say,  a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day and who they really are and would ideally be able to contribute to existence. Marx also argued that specialised jobs are insecure, since they make the worker utterly expendable the minute costs rise and savings can be made through technology.  <ref>Marx, Karl. \"Comment on James Mill,\" \'\'Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\'\': 1844.</ref>\n\nSince workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive stress injuries]] are a possible pathology of [[occupational safety]]. [[Industrial noise]] also proved dangerous. When it was not too high, workers were often prohibited from talking. [[Charles Piaget]], a [[skilled worker]] at the [[LIP factory]], recalled that beside being prohibited from speaking, the semi-skilled workers had only 25 centimeters in which to move.<ref>{{cite interview|url = http://www.mouvements.asso.fr/spip.php?article52|title = Le?ons d\'autogestion|trans-title = Autogestion Lessons|interviewer = |language = fr|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/20070707192357/http://www.mouvements.asso.fr:80/spip.php?article52|archivedate = 7 July 2007}}</ref> Industrial [[ergonomics]] later tried to minimize physical trauma.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies|Business and economics}}\n*[[Production line]]\n*[[Industrial engineering]]\n*[[Fordism]]\n*[[Modern Times (film)]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |ref= harv |last= Borth |first= Christy |year= 1945 |title= Masters of Mass Production |publisher= Bobbs-Merrill Company |location= Indianapolis }}\n* {{cite book |ref= harv |first= Robert W. |last= Domm |year= 2009 |title= Michigan Yesterday & Today |location= |publisher= Voyageur Press |url= http://books.google.com/?id=HQdTa9ZXlVAC&pg=PA29 |isbn= 9780760333853}}\n* {{cite book |ref= harv |last1= Ford |first1= Henry |last2= Crowther |first2= Samuel |authorlink= Henry Ford |lastauthoramp= yes |year= 1922 |title= My Life and Work |publisher= Garden City Publishing |location= Garden City, NY |url = http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/7213 |isbn= 0-405-05088-7 }}\n* {{cite book |ref= harv |last= Herman |first= Arthur |year= 2012 |title= Freedom\'s Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II |publisher= Random House |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-4000-6964-4}}\n*{{cite book |ref= harv |last1= Merson |first1= John |year= 1990 |title= The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World  |publisher= The Overlook Press |location=Woodstock, NY |isbn=  0-87951-397-7 | postscript= .

Light\'s survey was completed in this period and land was promptly offered for sale to early colonists. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.\n\n[[George Gawler|Governor Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the \'\'Select Committee on South Australia\'\' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor\'s house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a [[Customs House Port Adelaide|customs house]] and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. In addition, houses for public officials and missionaries and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler\'s governorship. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficient during this period, but at heavy cost: as a result of Gawler\'s public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey|Governor Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide\'s commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nTrade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the [[Murray River]] being successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident.

In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia\'s exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] provided some relief.

Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments.

His plan, now known as \'\'\'Light\'s Vision\'\'\', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light\'s selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia\'s first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.<ref>Page, M. (1981): \'\'Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851-1979.\'\' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17-20. ISBN 0727015109</ref> Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition.\n\nThe benefits of Light\'s design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp \'\'Adelaide\'s Inner and Outer Ring Routes\'\'], 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport. {{wayback|url=http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=20140306220115 }}</ref>\n[[File:Torrens River at night.jpg|thumb|Footbridge across the Torrens River, with the [[Adelaide Oval|Adelaide Oval stadium]] in the background.]]\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light\'s original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and \"country towns\", as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide\'s [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].\n\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully\'s]] transport woes in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adelaide\'s Freeways ?

The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 \"Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village\"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

A relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.<ref>Gibbs, R.M.

After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of \"double brick\" construction upon \"dwarf wall\" foundations.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Progressively since then there has been a move to \"[[brick veneer]]\" over a timber frame on a concrete slab foundation, and more recently, over a steel frame. In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide\'s suburban history is the role of the [[South Australian Housing Trust]].\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many of the older houses were demolished and replaced by \"home units\" ? a group of three-to-five single-storey dwellings on a common title with shared access.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Two-storey blocks of flats were also common in this period. [[Dutch Colonial]] architecture is rare in Adelaide, but there are a few noteworthy examples in the style popularised in the United States, in the 1960s. The style was brought to South Australia by George Gavin Lawson. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In the 21st century, a significant factor is the government policy of \"Urban infill\", where single-storey detached houses are being demolished, the land subdivided, and double-storey semi-detached \"town-houses\" are being built in their place.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Adelaide}}\nAdelaide has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K?ppen climate classification]] \'\'Csa\'\'),<ref>{{cite book |last=Tapper |first=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First |editor=Gray, Kathleen |page=300}}</ref> with hot dry summers and mild winters, with most [[precipitation]] falling in the winter months.

In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&nbsp;mm. [[Frosts]] are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter.

Adelaide\'s professional association football team, [[Adelaide United]], play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few [[Soccer-specific stadium|purpose-built soccer stadia]] in Australia.\n\nFor two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia\'s top level [[rugby league]], after the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The [[Adelaide Rams]] were formed and played in the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] (SL) competition in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]] before moving to the new [[National Rugby League]] in [[1998 NRL season|1998]]. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the [[Australian Rugby League]] to end the [[Super League war]], the club\'s owners [[News Limited]] (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]].\n\nAdelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men\'s team being the [[Adelaide 36ers]] who play in the [[National Basketball League Australia]] and the women\'s team, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] who play in the [[Women\'s National Basketball League]]. Both teams play their home games at the [[Adelaide Arena]]. Adelaide has a professional [[netball]] team, the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], who play in the trans-Tasman netball competition, the [[ANZ Championship]], with home games played at [[ETSA Park]]. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, while international netball matches are usually played at either the Entertainment Centre or the Adelaide Arena.\n[[File:Tourdownunder2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tour Down Under]] is the first event of the [[UCI World Tour]] calendar. ]]\nSince 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas has hosted the [[Tour Down Under]] [[Bicycle racing|bicycle race]], organised and directed by Adelaide-based [[Mike Turtur]].

The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted [[UCI ProTour]] status. Adelaide maintains a franchise in the [[Australian Baseball League]], the [[Adelaide Bite]]. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium is [[Norwood Oval|Coopers Stadium]]. Their name stems from the local [[Great Australian Bight]], and from the abundance of local [[Great White Shark]]s.

The Classic Adelaide, a [[rallying|rally]] of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.\n\nThe [[World Solar Challenge]] race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbowls2012.com/|title=worldbowls2012.com|work=Independent Insurance}}</ref>  at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.\n\n[[Dirt track racing|Dirt track speedway]] is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. [[Speedway City]], located adjacent to the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] road racing circuit at [[Virginia, South Australia|Virginia]] ({{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979.

Additional RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are in the suburbs of Adelaide ? the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. Adelaide also hosts numerous private hospitals in the city centre and suburbs.\n\nIn June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital at the east end of the city. The new 800-bed hospital has a cost of A$1.85 billion and was planned to be named the \"Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital\" after the [[Marjorie Jackson|former Governor of South Australia]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Owen | first = Michael | title =800 beds, helipad and train station: Our \'Marj\' hospital | newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | page = 5 | date = 7 June 2007 |url=}}</ref> However, in 2009, at the former governor\'s request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility.

The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|metropolitan railways]] (with diesel and electric lines), and the Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]], which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]].

His work is firmly rooted in the landscape, history and folklore of his native county of [[Cheshire]], [[North West England]], being set in the region and making use of the native [[Cheshire dialect]].\n\nBorn in [[Congleton]], Garner grew up around the nearby town of [[Alderley Edge]], and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as \'The Edge\', where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region. Studying at Manchester Grammar School and then briefly at [[Oxford University]], in 1957 he moved to the nearby village of Blackden, where he bought and renovated an Early Modern building known as Toad Hall. His first novel, \'\'[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]\'\', was published in 1960. A children\'s fantasy novel set on the Edge, it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters. Garner completed a sequel, \'\'[[The Moon of Gomrath]]\'\' (1963), but left the third book of the trilogy he had envisioned. Instead he produced a string of further fantasy novels, \'\'[[Elidor]]\'\' (1965), \'\'[[The Owl Service]]\'\' (1967) and \'\'[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]\'\' (1973).\n\nTurning away from fantasy as a genre, Garner produced \'\'[[The Stone Book Quartet]]\'\' (1979), a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family. He also published a series of British folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled \'\'Alan Garner\'s Fairy Tales of Gold\'\' (1979), \'\'Alan Garner\'s Book of British Fairy Tales\'\' (1984) and \'\'A Bag of Moonshine\'\' (1986). In his subsequent novels, \'\'[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]\'\' (1996) and \'\'[[Thursbitch (novel)|Thursbitch]]\'\' (2003), he continued writing tales revolving around Cheshire, although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work. In 2012, he finally published a third book in the Weirdstone trilogy, \'\'[[Boneland]]\'\'.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life: 1934?56===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|\"I had to get aback [to familial ways of doing things], by using skills that had been denied to my ancestors; but I had nothing that they would have called worthwhile.

Instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about The Edge.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Garner later remarked that as a result he was \"aware of [the Edge\'s] magic\" as a child, and he and his friends often played there.{{sfn|Garner|2010|p=9}} The story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life, becoming, he explained, \"deeply embedded in my psyche\" and heavily influencing his later novels.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner faced several life-threatening childhood illnesses, which left him bed ridden for much of the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} He went to a local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native [[Cheshire dialect]];{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=11}} for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} Garner then won a place at [[Manchester Grammar School]], where he received his secondary education; entry was means-tested, resulting in his school fees being waived.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]].{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=12}} He was then conscripted into [[national service]], serving for a time with the [[Royal Artillery]] while posted to [[Woolwich]] in [[South East (London sub region)|Southeast London]].{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}}\n\nAt school, he Garner had developed a keen interest in the work of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Homer]], as well as the [[Ancient Greek language]].{{sfn|Garth|2013}} Thus, he decided to pursue the study of [[Classics]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his \"cultural background\" and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who \"could not cope with me, and I could not cope with\" them.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Looking back, he remarked, \"I soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over regular verbs\".{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of [[Mark Antony]] in a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]\'s \'\'[[Antony and Cleopatra]]\'\' where he co-starred alongside [[Dudley Moore]] and where [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] was the stage manager.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained \"a permanent strength through all my life\".{{sfn|Garth|2013}}\n\n===\'\'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen\'\' and \'\'The Moon of Gomrath\'\': 1957?64===\n\nAged 22, Garner was out cycling when he came across a hand-painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in Toad Hall &ndash; a Late Medieval building situated in Blackden, seven miles from Alderley Edge &ndash; was on sale for ?510. Although he personally could not afford it, he was lent the money by the local [[Oddfellow]] lodge, enabling him to purchase and move in to the cottage in June 1957.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackden Trust|1y=2008|2a1=Pitts|2a2=Garner|2y=2014|2p=14}} In the late nineteenth century the Hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers\' cottages, but Garner was able to purchase the second for ?150 about a year later; he proceeded to knock down the dividing walls and convert both halves back into a single home.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackden Trust|1y=2008|2a1=Pitts|2a2=Garner|2y=2014|2p=14}}\n\n[[File:Toad Hall at Blackden.JPG|thumb|left|In 1957, Garner purchased and began renovating Toad Hall at Blackden, Cheshire]]\n\nGarner had begun writing his first novel, \'\'[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen|The Weirdstone of Brisingamen: A Tale of Alderley]]\'\', in September 1956.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=12}} However it was while at Toad Hall that he finished the book. Set in Alderley Edge, it revolved around two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to live in the area with their mother\'s old nurse maid, Bess, and her husband, Gowther Mossock. Setting about to explore the Edge, they discover a race of malevolent creatures, the \'\'svart alfar\'\', who dwell in the Edge\'s abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them, until they are rescued by the wizard Cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are amassing at the Edge in search of the titular \"weirdstone of Brisingamen\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|pp=12&ndash;13}} Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that \"I couldn\'t write and teach; the energies were too similar\", and so began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner sent his debut novel to the publishing company [[William Collins, Sons and Co Ltd|Collins]], where it was picked up by the company\'s head, Sir William Collins, who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]\'s \'\'[[The Lord of the Rings]]\'\' (1954?55).{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} Garner, who went on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that \"Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} On its release in 1960, \'\'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen\'\' proved to be a critical and commercial success,{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Lake|2y=2010|2pp=316&ndash;317}} later being described as \"a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|pp=316?317}} Garner himself however would later denounce this novel as \"a fairly bad book\" in 1968.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=23}}\n\nWith his first book published, Garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter, living a \"hand to mouth\" lifestyle on a \"shoestring\" budget.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} He also worked on a sequel to \'\'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen\'\', which would be known as \'\'[[The Moon of Gomrath]]\'\'. \'\'The Moon of Gomrath\'\' also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan, with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the [[Brollachan]] who has recently entered the world. With the help of the wizard Cadellin, the Brollachan is exorcised, but Susan\'s soul also leaves her body, being sent to another dimension, leading Colin to find a way to bring it back.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} Critic Neil Philip characterised it as \"an artistic advance\" but \"a less satisfying story\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} In a 1989 interview, Garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan, envisioning a trilogy, but that he had intentionally decided not to write it, instead moving on to write something different.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} However \'\'Boneland\'\', the conclusion to the sequence, was belatedly published in August 2012.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/15/alan-garner-weirdstone-brisingamen-trilogy-boneland \"Alan Garner to conclude Weirdstone of Brisingamen trilogy\"].

Inspired by this design, he produced his fourth novel, \'\'[[The Owl Service]]\'\'.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} The story was also heavily influenced by the Medieval Welsh tale of [[Math fab Mathonwy]] from, the \'\'[[Mabinogion]]\'\'.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} \'\'The Owl Service\'\' was critically acclaimed, winning both the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and [[Guardian Children\'s Fiction Prize]].{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} It also sparked discussions among critics as to whether Garner should properly be considered a children\'s writer, given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}}\n\nIt took Garner six years to write his next novel, \'\'[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]\'\'.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}} In this, he provided three intertwined love stories, one set in the present, another during the [[English Civil War]], and the third in the second century CE.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}} Philip referred to it as \"a complex book but not a complicated one: the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\nAcademic specialist in children\'s literature Maria Nikolajeva characterised \'\'Red Shift\'\' as \"a difficult book\" for an unprepared reader, identifying its main themes as those of \"loneliness and failure to communicate\".{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=128}} Ultimately, she thought that repeated re-readings of the novel bring about the realisation that \"it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so-called \"realistic\" juvenile novels.\"{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=131}}\n\n===\'\'The Stone Book\'\' series and folkloric collections: 1974?94===\n\nFrom 1976 to 1978, Garner published a series of four novellas, which have come to be collectively known as \'\'[[The Stone Book]]\'\' quartet: \'\'The Stone Book\'\', \'\'Granny Reardun\'\', \'\'The Aimer Gate\'\', and \'\'Tom Fobble\'s Day\'\'.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}} Each focused on a day in the life of a child in the Garner family, each from a different generation.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}}\nIn a 1989 interview, Garner noted that although writing \'\'The Stone Book Quartet\'\' had been \"exhausting\", it had been \"the most rewarding of everything\" he\'d done to date.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Philip described the quartet as \"a complete command of the material he had been working and reworking since the start of his career\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\nGarner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading \"[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]\": the footnotes would not have been needed by his father.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 1981, the literary critic Neil Philip published an analysis of Garner\'s novels as \'\'A Fine Anger\'\', which was based on his doctoral thesis, produced for the [[University of London]] in 1980.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=9}} In this study he noted that \"\'\'The Stone Book\'\' quartet marks a watershed in Garner\'s writing career, and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far.\"{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}}\n\n===\'\'Strandloper\'\', \'\'Thursbitch\'\' and \'\'Boneland\'\': 1995&ndash;present===\n\n[[File:Garner in the field.jpg|thumb|right|Garner at his home in Blackden, 2011]]\n\nIn 1996, Garner\'s novel \'\'[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]\'\' was published. His collection of essays and public talks, \'\'The Voice That Thunders\'\', contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with [[bipolar disorder]]), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In \'\'The Voice That Thunders\'\' he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought (at the height of the [[neoliberal]] tide) which preceded \'\'Strandloper\'\' to \'forsake \"literature\", and become instead a \"popular\" writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books\'.<ref>Alan Garner, \'\'The Voice That Thunders\'\' (London 1997), p. 35.</ref> Garner feared that \"making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death\"<ref>Garner, \'\'Thunders\'\', p. 36.</ref> and felt unable to comply.\n\nGarner\'s novel, \'\'[[Thursbitch]]\'\', was published in 2003. Garner\'s novel, \'\'Boneland\'\', was published in 2012, nominally completing a trilogy begun some 50 years earlier with \'\'[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]\'\'.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWith his first wife Anne Cook he had three children.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In 1972 he married for a second time, this time to Griselda Greaves, a teacher and critic with whom he had two children.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In a 2014 interview conducted with [[Mike Pitts]] for \'\'British Archaeology\'\' magazine, Garner stated that \"I don\'t have anything to do with the literary world. I avoid writers. I don\'t like them. Most of my close personal friends are professional archaeologists.\"{{sfn|Pitts|Garner|2014|p=15}}\n\n==Literary style==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|\"I have four filing cabinets of correspondence from readers, and over the years the message is clear and unwavering. Readers under the age of eighteen read what I write with more passion, understanding, and clarity of perception than do adults. Adults bog down, claim that I\'m difficult, obscurantist, wilful, and sometimes simply trying to confuse. I\'m not; I\'m just trying to get the simple story simply told... I didn\'t consciously set out to write for children, but somehow I connect with them. I think that\'s something to do with my psychopathology, and I\'m not equipped to evaluate it.\"|source = Alan Garner, 1989{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} }}\n\nAlthough Garner\'s early work is often labelled as \"children\'s literature\", Garner himself rejects such a description, informing one interviewer that \"I certainly have never written for children\" but that instead he has always written purely for himself.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Neil Philip, in his critical study of Garner\'s work (1981), commented that up till that point, \"Everything Alan Garner has published has been published for children\",{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=7}} although he went on to relate that \"It may be that Garner\'s is a case\" where the division between children\'s and adult\'s literature is \"meaningless\" and that his fiction is instead \"enjoyed by a type of person, no matter what their age.\"{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=8}}\n\nPhilip offered the opinion that the \"essence of his work\" was \"the struggle to render the complex in simple, bare terms; to couch the abstract in the concrete and communicate it directly to the reader\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=9}} He added that Garner\'s work is \"intensely autobiographical, in both obvious and subtle ways\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=9}} Highlighting Garner\'s use of mythological and folkloric sources, Philip stated that his work explores \"the disjointed and troubled psychological and emotional landscape of the twentieth century through the symbolism of myth and folklore.\"{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=21}} He also expressed the opinion that \"Time is Gardner\'s most consistent theme\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\n\nThe English author and academic [[Charles Butler (author)|Charles Butler]] noted that Garner was attentive to the \"geological, archaeological and cultural history of his settings, and careful to integrate his fiction with the physical reality beyond the page.\"{{sfn|Butler|2009|p=146}} As a part of this, Garner had included maps of Alderley Edge in both \'\'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen\'\' and \'\'The Moon of Gomrath\'\'.{{sfn|Butler|2009|pp=146?147}} Garner has spent much time investigating the areas that he deals with in his books; writing in the \'\'[[Times Literary Supplement]]\'\' in 1968, Garner commented that in preparation for writing his book \'\'Elidor\'\':\n\n:I had to read extensively textbooks on physics, Celtic symbolism, unicorns, medieval watermarks, megalithic archaeology; study the writings of [[Carl Jung|Jung]]; brush up my [[Plato]]; visit [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill|Silbury]] and [[Coventry Cathedral]]; spend a lot of time with demolition gangs on slum clearance sites; and listen to the whole of [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]\'s \'\'[[War Requiem]]\'\' nearly every day.{{sfn|Garner|1968|p=577}}\n\n==Recognition and legacy==\n\n[[File:The Medicine House.JPG|thumb|right|The Medicine House, an Early Modern building that was moved to Blackden by Garner.]]\n\nIn a paper published in the \'\'[[Children\'s Literature Association Quarterly]]\'\', Maria Nikolajeva characterised Garner as \"one of the most controversial\" authors of modern children\'s literature.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=128}}\n\nIn the fiftieth anniversary edition of \'\'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen\'\', published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2010, several notable British fantasy novelists praised Garner and his work. [[Susan Cooper]] related that \"The power and range of Alan Garner\'s astounding talent has grown with every book he\'s written\", whilst [[David Almond]] called him one of Britain\'s \"greatest writers\" whose works \"really matter\".{{sfnm|1a1=Pullman|1a2=Gaiman|1a3=Cooper|1a4=Nix|1a5=Almond|1a6=Faber|1y=2010|1p=2}} [[Philip Pullman]], the author of the \'\'[[His Dark Materials]]\'\' trilogy, went further when he remarked that:\n\n:\"Garner is indisputably the great originator, the most important British writer of fantasy since [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], and in many respects better than Tolkien, because deeper and more truthful... Any country except Britain would have long ago recognised his importance, and celebrated it with postage stamps and statues and street-names. But that\'s the way with us: our greatest prophets go unnoticed by the politicians and the owners of media empires. I salute him with the most heartfelt respect and admiration.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Pullman|1a2=Gaiman|1a3=Cooper|1a4=Nix|1a5=Almond|1a6=Faber|1y=2010|1p=1}}\n\nAnother British fantasy writer, [[Neil Gaiman]], claimed that \"Garner\'s fiction is something special\" in that it was \"smart and challenging, based in the here and the now, in which real English places emerged from the shadows of folklore, and in which people found themselves walking, living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Pullman|1a2=Gaiman|1a3=Cooper|1a4=Nix|1a5=Almond|1a6=Faber|1y=2010|1p=1}} Praise also came from Nick Lake, the editorial director of [[HarperCollins]] Children\'s Books, who proclaimed that \"Garner is, quite simply, one of the greatest and most influential writers this country has ever produced.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|pp=315?316}}\n\n===Awards===\n\nThe biennial [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] conferred by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children\'s books.

'Algebraic_number'	'{{Confuse|Algebraic solution}}\n\nAn \'\'\'algebraic number\'\'\' is any [[complex number]] that is a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently ? by clearing [[denominator]]s ? with [[integer]] coefficients). All [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s are algebraic. The same is not true for [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s because of [[transcendental number]]s such as [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]. [[Almost all]] real and complex numbers are transcendental.<ref>See [[#Properties|Properties]].</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n*The [[rational number]]s, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s \'\'a\'\' and \'\'b\'\', \'\'b\'\' not equal to zero, satisfy the above definition because {{nowrap|1=\'\'x\'\' = \'\'a\'\'/\'\'b\'\'}} is the root of {{nowrap|\'\'bx\'\' ? \'\'a\'\'}}.<ref>Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972:159?160 and pp. 178?179</ref>\n\n*The [[quadratic surd]]s (irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial {{nowrap|\'\'ax\'\'{{sup|2}} + \'\'bx\'\' + \'\'c\'\'}} with integer coefficients \'\'a\'\', \'\'b\'\', and \'\'c\'\') are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic ({{nowrap|1=\'\'a\'\' = 1}}) then the roots are [[quadratic integer]]s.\n\n*The [[constructible number]]s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots. (Note that by designating cardinal directions for 1, ?1, \'\'i\'\', and ?\'\'i\'\', complex numbers such as {{nowrap|3 + ?2\'\'i\'\'}} are considered constructible.)\n\n*Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|\'\'n\'\'th roots]] gives another algebraic number.\n\n*Polynomial roots that \'\'cannot\'\' be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of \'\'n\'\'th roots (such as the roots of {{nowrap|\'\'x\'\'{{sup|5}} ? \'\'x\'\' + 1}}). This [[Abel?Ruffini theorem|happens with many]], but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.\n\n*[[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers {{nowrap|\'\'a\'\' + \'\'bi\'\'}} where both \'\'a\'\' and \'\'b\'\' are integers are also quadratic integers.\n\n*[[Trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of {{pi}} (except when undefined): that is, the [[trigonometric number]]s. For example, each of {{nowrap|cos({{pi}}/7)}}, {{nowrap|cos(3{{pi}}/7)}}, {{nowrap|cos(5{{pi}}/7)}} satisfies {{nowrap|1=8\'\'x\'\'{{sup|3}} ? 4\'\'x\'\'{{sup|2}} ? 4\'\'x\'\' + 1 = 0}}. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are \'\'conjugate\'\' algebraic numbers. Likewise, {{nowrap|tan(3{{pi}}/16)}}, {{nowrap|tan(7{{pi}}/16)}}, {{nowrap|tan(11{{pi}}/16)}}, {{nowrap|tan(15{{pi}}/16)}} all satisfy the irreducible polynomial {{nowrap|1=\'\'x\'\'{{sup|4}} ? 4\'\'x\'\'{{sup|3}} ? 6\'\'x\'\'{{sup|2}} + 4x + 1}}, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].\n\n*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:\n**The numbers {{nowrap|?2}} and {{nowrap|{{sup|3}}?3/2}} are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials {{nowrap|\'\'x\'\'{{sup|2}} ? 2}} and {{nowrap|8\'\'x\'\'{{sup|3}} ? 3}}, respectively.\n**The [[golden ratio]] \'\'&phi;\'\' is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial {{nowrap|\'\'x\'\'{{sup|2}} ? \'\'x\'\' ? 1}}.\n**The numbers [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|\'\'e\'\']] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann?Weierstrass theorem]]);<ref>Also [[Liouville number|Liouville\'s theorem]] can be used to \"produce as many examples of transcendentals numbers as we please,\" cf Hardy and Wright p. 161ff</ref> hence they are transcendental.\n\n=={{anchor|Degree of an algebraic number}} Properties==\n<!-- This anchor tag serves to provide a  target for incoming section links.

The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree ?5. This is a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel?Ruffini theorem]]). An example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial {{nowrap|\'\'x\'\'<sup>5</sup> ? \'\'x\'\' ? 1}} (which is approximately 1.167304).\n\n===Closed-form number===\n{{Main|Closed-form number}}\nAlgebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to \"[[closed-form number]]s\", which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called \"elementary numbers\", and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers \'\'explicitly\'\' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms ? this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as \'\'e\'\' or log(2).\n\n==Algebraic integers==\n{{Main|Algebraic integer}}\n[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer)]]\nAn \'\'\'[[algebraic integer]]\'\'\' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial).

'Automorphism'	'In [[mathematics]], an \'\'\'automorphism\'\'\' is an [[isomorphism]] from a [[mathematical object]] to itself. It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the \'\'\'automorphism group\'\'\'. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.\n\n==Definition==\nThe exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of \"mathematical object\" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an \"isomorphism\" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.\n\nIn category theory, an automorphism is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e. a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).\n\nThis is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren\'t necessarily functions and objects aren\'t necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.\n\nIn the context of [[abstract algebra]], for example, a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An isomorphism is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]]. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example: [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).\n\nThe [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the \'\'\'trivial automorphism\'\'\' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called \'\'\'nontrivial automorphisms\'\'\'.\n\n==Automorphism group==\nIf the automorphisms of an object \'\'X\'\' form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the \'\'\'automorphism group\'\'\' of \'\'X\'\'. That this is indeed a group is simple to see:\n* [[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: composition of two endomorphisms is another endomorphism.\n* [[Associativity]]: composition of morphisms is \'\'always\'\' associative.\n* [[Identity element|Identity]]: the identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself, which exists by definition.\n* [[Inverse element|Inverses]]: by definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.\n\nThe automorphism group of an object \'\'X\'\' in a category \'\'C\'\' is denoted Aut<sub>\'\'C\'\'</sub>(\'\'X\'\'), or simply Aut(\'\'X\'\') if the category is clear from context.\n\n==Examples==\n* In [[set theory]], an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of a set \'\'X\'\' is an automorphism. The automorphism group of \'\'X\'\' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on \'\'X\'\'.\n* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, \'\'\'Z\'\'\', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.\n* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group \'\'G\'\' there is a natural group homomorphism \'\'G\'\' ? Aut(\'\'G\'\') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(\'\'G\'\') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of \'\'G\'\'. Thus, if \'\'G\'\' has [[Trivial group|trivial]] center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.<ref name=Pahl>\n\n{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kvoaoWOfqd8C&pg=PA376 |page=376 |chapter=?7.5.5 Automorphisms |title=Mathematical foundations of computational engineering |edition=Felix Pahl translation |author=PJ Pahl, R Damrath |isbn=3-540-67995-2 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer}}\n\n</ref>\n* In [[linear algebra]], an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] \'\'V\'\' is a [[linear transformation|linear operator]] \'\'V\'\' ? \'\'V\'\'.

When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of \'\'V\'\' is the same as the [[general linear group]], GL(\'\'V\'\').\n* An example of an automorphism is a [[similarity transform]], which leaves the geometrical form of a figure unchanged.<ref>Klaus Maintzer: \'\'Local activity principle: The cause of complexity and symmetry breaking\'\', Chapter 12 (pages 146?159).

Some subfields of \'\'\'R\'\'\' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of \'\'\'R\'\'\' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in \'\'\'R\'\'\').

In the case of a Galois extension \'\'L\'\'/\'\'K\'\' the [[subgroup]] of all automorphisms of \'\'L\'\' fixing \'\'K\'\' pointwise is called the [[Galois group]] of the extension.\n*The field  \'\'\'Q\'\'\'<sub>\'\'p\'\'</sub> of p-adic numbers has no nontrivial automorphisms.\n* In [[graph theory]] an [[graph automorphism|automorphism of a graph]] is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.\n* For relations, see [[Isomorphism#A relation-preserving isomorphism|relation-preserving automorphism]].\n** In [[order theory]], see [[order automorphism]].\n* In [[geometry]], an automorphism may be called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:\n** In [[metric geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].\n** In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a bijective [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[M?bius transformation]]s.\n** An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] \'\'M\'\' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from \'\'M\'\' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(\'\'M\'\').\n** In [[topology]], morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is \'\'not sufficient\'\' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[icosian calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Memorandum respecting a new System of Roots of Unity\n|author=Sir William Rowan Hamilton\n|author-link=William Rowan Hamilton\n|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Icosian/NewSys.pdf\n|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]\n|volume=12\n|year=1856\n|pages=446\n}}</ref> writing:\n<blockquote>so that <math>\\mu</math> is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root <math>\\lambda</math> by relations of perfect reciprocity.</blockquote>\n\n==Inner and outer automorphisms==\nIn some categories?notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s?it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called \"inner\" and \"outer\" automorphisms.\n\nIn the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element \'\'a\'\' of a group \'\'G\'\', conjugation by \'\'a\'\' is the operation {{nowrap|\'\'?\'\'<sub>\'\'a\'\'</sub> : \'\'G\'\' ? \'\'G\'\'}} given by {{nowrap|1=\'\'?\'\'<sub>\'\'a\'\'</sub>(\'\'g\'\') = \'\'aga\'\'<sup>?1</sup>}} (or \'\'a\'\'<sup>?1</sup>\'\'ga\'\'; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by \'\'a\'\' is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a [[normal subgroup]] of Aut(\'\'G\'\'), denoted by Inn(\'\'G\'\'); this is called [[Goursat\'s lemma]].\n\nThe other automorphisms are called [[outer automorphism]]s. The [[quotient group]] {{nowrap|Aut(\'\'G\'\') / Inn(\'\'G\'\')}} is usually denoted by Out(\'\'G\'\'); the non-trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms.\n\nThe same definition holds in any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or [[algebra over a field|algebra]] where \'\'a\'\' is any [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]. For [[Lie algebra]]s the definition is slightly different.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endomorphism ring]]\n* [[Antiautomorphism]]\n* [[Frobenius automorphism]]\n* [[Morphism]]\n* [[Characteristic subgroup]]\n\n==References==\n<!-- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for instructions. -->\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Automorphism \'\'Automorphism\'\' at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=Automorphism | title = Automorphism}}\n\n[[Category:Morphisms]]\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]\n[[Category:Symmetry]]'

For instance, statements like \"the algebraic numbers form a field\" or \"the algebraic numbers are countable\" are false if we leave it open like that. Also, many other pages that link here and describe properties of algebraic numbers would have to be qualified, since many of these statements don\'t work for p-adic algebraic numbers.\n\nI\'ll try to do something about this issue, but other suggestions are welcome. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 18:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:As far as I can think of the term \"algebraic number\" is reserved for a root of a polynomial with coefficients in the rationals. The p-adic numbers are not \'\'algebraic\'\', specifically because they are obtained by the \'\'analytic\'\' process of \'\'completing\'\' the rational numbers. One can speak of elements that are algebraic over a p-adic number field, but then one enters the more general concept of [[algebraic element]]s. For this reason, I will modify the introduction of this article, I\'ll also make some changes to the rest. [[User:RobHar|RobHar]] 20:50, 22 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n::No, that\'s not right. The algebraic closure of the rationals in the p-adic field is quite large. All those numbers are algebraic. There is no essential difference, abstractly, between those numbers and the algebraic closure of the rationals in the complex numbers. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] 22:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::Ah I see, I thought it was being said that the p-adic numbers were algebraic, but what was pointed out was that certain p-adic numbers are algebraic. Actually, any field of characteristic zero contains the rationals, so perhaps I shall replace \"complex number\" in the definition with something more general. Something like an algebraic number is a root of a polynomial over the rationals, it is often taken in the complex numbers but can be in any field of charateristic zero. Does that sound good? [[User:RobHar|RobHar]] 00:53, 23 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n\n::::  Yes, this is a very important point, both theoretically and computationally.  The definition needs to be changed, and I prefer to just leave it as a root of a polynomial, without reference to any particular field that the root lives in.  \n\n:::: An algebraic number can always be viewed as a number in some algebraically closure of the rational numbers, and all of these closures are isomorphic fields. However, there is no canonical description of such a closure. Any such closure can be viewed as embedded in the complex numbers, but again, there is no canonical way to view this embedding. Thus, an algebraic number can generally be thought of as a complex number, but not in a canonical way, and in general it is just an element of some algebraic closure of the rationals.\n\n:::: Since all algebraic closures are isomorphic, this may seem like a trivial point, but it\'s not. It plays a serious role in trying to write computational number theory programs. For instance, viewing the rational numbers as embedded in the complexes in the usual way, the roots of x3 ? 2 can be thought of as the real number \\sqrt[3]{2} and the two non-real roots \\zeta \\sqrt[3]{2}, \\zeta^2 \\sqrt[3]{2}, where ? is a cube root of unity. Here, one intuitively sees a huge distinction between the three roots -- the first is real, and the second two aren\'t. However, this distinction is an artifact of having fixed the complex numbers as an algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and having an intuitive feel for the distinction between real and non-real numbers.\n\n:::: To work with these numbers algebraically in a computer, you cannot ahead of time \"explain\" the intuitive notion of the complex numbers to the computer ahead of time, and then allow it to work with algebraic numbers of arbitrarily large degree by working within this field (at least, as far as I know no one can do this). Instead, all you tell the computer is that you are working with a root of x3 ? 2. Not only does the computer have no way to distinguish between the three roots from this description, there is no way for the computer to single out an algebraically closed field containing these roots.\n\n:::: Avoiding thinking of algebraic numbers as living in the complex numbers with a particular embedding is also important for theoretical reasons. Doing this is sort of like \"fixing a basis\" for a vector space when you don\'t have to -- working in a coordinate-free manner can often be important.\n\n:::: The above discussion is rather technical, from the point of view of someone who doesn\'t know much or anything about algebraic numbers and wants to learn from this page. To avoid much confusion, especially in the first sentence of the page, how about just referring to the algebraic number as a root of a polynomial. Discussion of what field to view this number in can be deferred until later in the article, at least not in the introduction.

I guess I read the change and was sort of surprised to read that. Perhaps the article on algebraic numbers is the one where I would least want pi and e to be called constants since the article discusses in some sense what numbers actually are. That the articles for pi and e refer to them as mathematical constants, I am definitely fine with since people will be looking up those definitions with all sorts of various fields in mind. However, I feel that in this case, pi and e are mentioned halfway through an article on what is definitely pure math (and where no functions are mentioned), and thus within the scope of this article I would rather refer to them as real numbers. Even more specifically, the section that they are mentioned in have a clear sentence pattern rational->irrational->complex->real that seems odd with constant instead of real. But yes I would like to see some discussion on this, as I actually don\'t know anything about what wikipedia thinks of the scope (and context) of referring to things.

Using the fuzzy term \"number\" is really not preferable. One can\'t say that numbers that aren\'t algebraic are transcendental, for example, is aleph_0 transcendental? Also, the writing is cumbersome, with all the parenthetical remarks. I intend on putting the old definition back, and editing many of the recent additions to make the writing style less cumbersome.

I simply intend on replacing the definition with what it was, and include a reference which actually has that definition verbatim, coincidently. My comment related to aleph_0 is about internal consistency, the wiki article on \"Number\" mentions all sorts of numbers, such as cardinals.

Basically, your editing of the lead paragraph is essentially the following two actions: 1. replace \"complex number\" with \"number\", and 2. replace \"with rational coefficients (or equivalently integer coefficients)\" with \"with integer coefficients\". I disagree with these changes and strongly disagree with the first one. You have simply taken away information. Can you tell me what was wrong with the lead paragraph before?

It proves that a set is uncountable.  You may be thinking of the argument that the rationals are countable which works by arranging them into a square grid and following diagonals.  In contrast, the diagonal argument shows that the set \'\'\'N\'\'\'<sup>\'\'\'N\'\'\'</sup> of sequences of natural numbers is uncountable by assuming for contradiction that the sequences can be enumerated as the list\n::\'\'?\'\'<sub>0</sub>, \'\'?\'\'<sub>1</sub>, \'\'?\'\'<sub>2</sub>, ?\n:and constructing a sequence \'\'?\'\' = (\'\'?\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub> + 1)<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub> which differs from the \'\'i\'\'th sequence in the \'\'i\'\'th place (i.e., on the \"diagonal\" you\'d see if you were to write out all these sequences).  Since \'\'?\'\' differs from every \'\'?\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub>, it cannot appear anywhere in the list, giving the desired contradiction.\n:I don\'t see anything that prevents the diagonal argument from being used to show that there are uncountably many transcendental numbers.  After all, it can be used to show that there are uncountably many [[complex number]]s, and it is straightforward to prove that the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals is countable.

Looking up that reference, one can see the proof given that indeed uses Cantor diagonalization (in one of its standard uses that shows that the reals are uncountable; having previously shown the algebraic numbers are countable, the result follows). [[Almost all]] means for all but a set of measure zero; in the case of [[counting measure]], this is indeed \"all but finitely many\", but for the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] on \'\'\'R\'\'\', other \"bigger\" sets have measure zero (e.g. any countable set, or the [[Cantor set]]), and looking up [[almost all]] on wiki gives this definition.

You say (if I understand you correctly) that keeping it purposely vague is good because it avoids making it too specific; but I think that the effect on the typical reader is going to be just the opposite -- making it seem more specific (real numbers only) than it is intended to be.\n\nSecond, you\'ve reverted \n\n:\'\'...a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients. Since polynomials with rational coefficients can be multiplied through by the lowest common multiple of the rational coefficients to get a polynomial with integer coefficients but having the same roots, this definition can also be restated to specify that the polynomial has [[integer]] coefficients.\'\'\n\nto the original shorter version\n\n:\'\'...a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently [[integer]] coefficients).\'\'\n\nsaying it\'s \'\'unnecessary in lede to expound upon equivalence of rational/integer coeffs\'\'.

Regarding the first reversion: I guess my opinion is that when the typical reader sees \"number\" they will think \"number\", whereas if they see \"complex number\" they will think \"oh, this is complicated\". In some sense, the laymam has an intuitive notion of numbers, and while it\'s true that that intuition likely does not consider complex numbers, it is also not really thinking of real numbers in the way that you and I think of them. I think it\'s worth pointing out that not all algebraic (complex) numbers are real, but I don\'t think it\'s necessary to do so in the first sentence of the article.\n\n:Regarding the second reversion: I\'d just like to keep parenthetical comments out of the lede. One option is to include your explanation as a footnote. I think I\'d rather remove any mention of integer coefficients in the lede than expound upon why the two are equivalent in the main text of the lede.\n\n:Best, [[User:RobHar|RobHar]] ([[User talk:RobHar|talk]]) 22:14, 7 January 2012 (UTC)\n\n::Hi Duoduoduo and RobHar. Thanks for working on this very good article, and I\'d like to add my opinion to your conversation. \n\n::1st revert: 3Duo says \"...the non-mathematician reader who does not know about this will probably interpret \"a number\" as referring to a real number.\" Well, I certainly do, so I go along with 3Duo: you should mention that complex numbers are meant. Instead of 3Duos \"...a complex number, real or non-real, ...\" I suggest \"real or complex number\" - seems simpler to me, and isn\'t this common usage?\n\n::2nd revert: I find 3Duos sentence \"Since polynomials ...\" fine, but RobHar also has a point about parenthetical comments in the lede. The current version (or equivalently ? by clearing denominators ? with integer coefficients) is an excellent compromise: the added \"by clearing denominators\" is absolutely necessary.\n\n::3Duo is right to keep the general reader in mind.

Nevertheless, in Europe and North America, [[Accordion#Use in popular music|some popular music acts]] also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is also used in [[Cajun music|cajun]], [[zydeco]], [[jazz music]] and in both solo and orchestra performances of [[classical music]].\nThe [[piano accordion]] is the official city instrument of [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite news|title=City Makes Accordion San Francisco\'s Official Instrument|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/City-Makes-Accordion-San-Francisco-s-Official-Instrument/id-376dd5a7b608f64b18abf834aaafc0fd|accessdate=24 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Associated Press|date=24 April 1990}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest name for this group of instruments is \'\'harmonika\'\', from the Greek \'\'harmonikos\'\', meaning \'\'harmonic, musical\'\'. Today, native versions of the name \'\'accordion\'\' are more common. These names refer to the type of accordion [[Accordion#History|patented by Cyrill Demian]], which concerned \"automatically coupled chords on the bass side\".<ref>Dyremose, Jeanette & Lars, \'\'Det levende b?lgspil\'\' (2003), p.133</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:Spirk.ogg|thumb|right|A [[diatonic button accordion]] being played.]]\nAccordions have many configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:\n* Some accordions are \'\'bisonoric\'\', producing different [[pitch (music)|pitches]] depending on the direction of bellows movement\n* Others are \'\'unisonoric\'\' and produce the same pitch in both directions. The pitch also depends on its size\n* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual\n* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual\n* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual\n* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]]\n* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might [[voicing (music)|voice]] a particular instrument\n\n=== Universal components ===\n\n==== Bellows ====\n{{Listen\n|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg\n|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds\n|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows - 949&nbsp;KB\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]\'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike\'s Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.\n\nThe keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows: some bellows effects as illustrated below:\n# Bellows used for volume control/fade\n# Repeated change of direction (\"bellows shake\"), which has been popularized by [[Luiz Gonzaga]]<ref>[http://www.almanaquebrasil.com.br/personalidades-musica/6505-luiz-gonzaga.html]</ref> and is extensively used in [[Forr?]] and called \"resfulengo\" in Brazil.\n# Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals\n# Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance\n# Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving, which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions particularly for this instrument\n\n==== Body ====\nThe accordion\'s body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals, respectively. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the [[sound]] to better project. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment, however skilled players can reverse these roles.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: \'\'Sharpshooter\'s March\'\' (1908) Guido Deiro, \'\'Guido Deiro\'s Own Story of Sharpshooters March\'\', \'\'The Pietro Musicordion\'\', Volume 6, Number 2 (May?June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as  to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n==== Pallet mechanism ====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both \'\'Det levende b?lgspil\'\' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and \'\'Harmonikaens historie\'\' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>\n\n[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|750px|thumb|center|An illustration of the pallet mechanism in Piano Accordions. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. Note that this is a side view of a piano accordion keyboard, so a similar effective mechanical pallet movement is used for buttons, both on button accordions and bass mechanisms, including the Stradella \'\'machine\'\']]\n\n=== Variable components ===\nThere is a wide range of instruments that are called \'\'accordion\'\'. The different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in several musical traditions, including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, Argentinian tango music and many other folk genres.\n\n==== Right-hand manual systems ====\n[[File:PianoAccordeon.jpg|166px|right|thumb|A [[Weltmeister]] piano accordion]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody. Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a [[Russia]]n variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants.)\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions?that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7-9 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer?rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].    \n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a [[piano]], at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows\n* [[6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6]] accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \'uniform\' or \'whole-tone\' arrangement. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row. So there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e. g. the \'logicordion\' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA]].\n\n==== Left-hand manual systems ====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|250px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called \'\'standard bass\'\', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for [[chord (music)|chords]]\n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in [[Belgium|Belgian]] chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has 3 rows of basses, 3 rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers 1 and 5, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of native Belgium\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming one\'s own chords. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called \"converter bass\".\n\n==== Reed banks and switches ====\n{{main|Accordion reed banks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|166px|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed banks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding \'\'banks\'\', which can be further combined into \'\'registers\'\' producing differing \'\'[[timbre]]s\'\'. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See the [[accordion reed banks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples.\n\nAll but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches.\n\n==== Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions ====\nIn describing/pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (3 octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as \'\'\'Reeds: 5 + 3\'\'\', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and \'\'\'Registers: 13 + M, 7\'\'\', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]].]]\n\n==== Straps ====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder [[straps]] to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.\n\nOther accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player\'s hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n=== Unusual accordions ===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|166px|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities ? only a few have remained in use:\n*The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion\n*The [[schwyzer?rgeli]] or [[Switzerland|Swiss]] organ, which usually has a 3-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement ?  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass ? that travel parallel to the bellows motion\n*The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]] has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass\n*In Scotland, the favoured diatonic accordion is the instrument known as the [[British Chromatic Accordion]]. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>p.98, Howard, Rob (2003) \'\'An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments\'\' Stockport: Robaccord Publications ISBN 978-0-9546711-0-5</ref>\n*{{ill|pl|Pedal harmony|Harmonia peda?owa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Free reed aerophone#History|l1=History of free reed aerophones}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\nThe accordion is a free reed instrument and is in the same family as other instruments such as the [[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and [[khaen]]. The sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today.\n\n[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|250px|right|thumb|8-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830)]]\n\nThe accordion\'s basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]] in 1822 by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]],<ref group=\"notes\">There is not a single document to back up this belief, Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann was 16 years old at that time and we do have some handwriting of C.F.

Moscow, 1997. (p.144)</ref>\n\nThe accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called \'\'accordion\'\' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]]<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 - 19 Jun 09 Using Way Back Machine to Display:\nThe Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref>\n\nDemian\'s instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a \'\'bisonoric\'\' action).\n\nThe piano accordion was first played in German-speaking regions, and then spread over Europe. Some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821, but it started to actually be played much later, and built its reputation from there.\n\nAt that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with \'\'Kanzellen\'\' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian\'s patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[Wiktionary|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l??t sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da? man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T?ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu? ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, w?rde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"\nTranslation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively.

His 1844 patent for what he called a ?concertina? also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|166px|The first pages in Adolph M?ller\'s accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M?ller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book, \'\'Schule f?r Accordion\'\'. At the time, [[Vienna]] and [[London]] had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune\'s [[flutina]] resembles Wheatstone\'s [[concertina]] in internal construction and [[tone color]], but it appears to complement Demian\'s accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to [[diatonic]] button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability.\n\n== Use in various music genres ==\n{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock, pop-rock, etc.,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n=== Use in traditional music ===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nInvented in 1829, its popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was spread by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians<ref>Christoph Wagner, \"A Brief History of How the Accordion Changed the World,\" CD booklet notes for Planet Squeezebox, performed by various artists, (Roslyn, New York: Ellipsis Arts, 1995), 6</ref> and has been integrated into [[traditional music]] styles all over the world: see the [[list of music styles that incorporate the accordion]].\n\n[[File:Italian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|thumb|This is a button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy.

A notable example is [[Grammy Award|Grammy Award winning]] [[Parody music|parodist]] [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks, particularly his [[polka]]s.  Yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child.<ref name=\"GraffDurchholz2012\">{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel|title=Rock \'n\' Roll Myths: The True Stories Behind the Most Infamous Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWlSUYbiUXUC&pg=PT152|year=2012|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61058-571-2|page=152}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in classical music ===\n{{Main|Accordion music genres#Use in classical music|l1=Accordion in classical music}}\n\nAlthough best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is \'\'{{lang|fr|Th?me vari? tr?s brillant pour accord?on methode Reisner}}\'\', written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of [[Paris]]. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]] (1915), wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.\n\nThe first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].<ref>[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm \'\'Accordion Composers in German\'\'] Accordion Online</ref> In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in \'\'[[Wozzeck]]\'\', Op. 7. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century<ref>Henry Doktorski, \"The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,\" The Classical Free-Reed, Inc. (1997)</ref> American composer [[William P. Perry]] featured the accordion in his orchestral suite \'\'Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie\'\' (2008). The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it.\n\nFrench composer [[Henri Dutilleux]] used an accordion in both his late song cycles \'\'Correspondances\'\' (2003) and \'\'[[Le Temps l\'horloge|Le Temps l\'Horloge]]\'\' (2009).\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nThe accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is the dominant instrument used in [[sevdalinka]], a traditional genre of [[folk music]] from Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe accordion is widely used in [[Brazil]], in traditional as well as pop music.   Compared to many other countries, the instrument enjoys in Brazil high popularity in mainstream pop music.   In some parts of the country, such as the North-East it is the most popular melodic instrument.   As opposed to most European folk, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil.\n\nThe accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forr?]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[bai?o (music)|Bai?o]]) as principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the King of the [[bai?o (music)|Bai?o]]) and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum).   This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the South-East of the country (in the [[Forr?]] Universit?rio genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada).   Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the S?o Jo?o Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music.\n\nIt is an important instrument in [[M?sica sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the Centre-west and South-east of Brazil and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country. In the South of the country (where there is a preponderance of the button accordion), in particular in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], it used in the Brazilian Ga?cho musical style, an important exponent of this music being [[Renato Borghetti]].\n\n=== Colombia ===\nThe accordion is also a traditional instrument in [[Colombia]], commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres. The accordion has been used by [[tropipop]] musicians such as [[Carlos Vives]], [[Andr?s Cabas]], [[Fonseca (singer)]] and [[Bacilos]], as well as [[rock music|rock]] musicians such as [[Juanes]] and pop musicians as [[Shakira]]. Vallenato, which emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, has come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia. The legend of the accordion\'s arrival in Colombia comes from a story of a ship wreck that was coming from Germany to Argentina. The wreck happened over the Magdalena river in the Atlantic coast.\n\nEvery year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the King of Kings accordion competition takes place, when winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the \'\'Pilonera Mayor\'\' prize.<ref>Smithsonian Channel, [http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=134604 \"The Accordion Kings\"], 15 August 2010.</ref> This is the world\'s largest competitive accordion festival.\n\n=== Use in heavy metal music ===\nAccordionists in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances.\n\nNotably, the Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] has always had a full-time accordionist, employing [[classical music|classical]] and [[polka]]-style sensibilities alongside a violinist. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death/folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] accordion known as a \'\'zuger?rgeli\'\', which could be a distant relative (in one way or another) to the Swiss [[schwyzer?rgeli]], as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of Switzerland.\n\n== Manufacturing process ==\n\nThe best accordions are always fully hand-made, especially in the aspect of reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a far better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured reeds. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,<ref>[http://www.irishdancemaster.com/ Yutaka Usuai], Japanese-born accordion craftsman.</ref> a Japanese-born craftsman.\n\nThe manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.<ref>[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081226093126/http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion how-products-encyclopedia_accordion] Old way Back link to: how-products-encyclopedia accordion</ref>\n\nFamous centres of production are the Italian cities of [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]] and [[Castelfidardo]], with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. The French town of Tulle has hosted Maugein Freres since 1919, and the company is now the last complete process manufacturer of accordions in France. Large-scale production existed in Germany by [[Hohner]] and [[Weltmeister]], but these lost volume by the end of the 20th century.  Hohner now manufactures in China; the [[Weltmeister]] instruments are still handmade by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA]] in Klingenthal, Germany.\n\n== Other audio samples ==\n<!-- Please keep the layout intact -->\n{| style=\"width:90%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:33%;\"|\n{{Listen|filename=Accordion chords-01.ogg|title=Accordion chords|description=Chords being played on an accordion ? 145&nbsp;KB |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n| style=\"width:33%;\"|\n{{Listen|filename=Accordion_registers.ogg|title=Accordion tones|description=Audio clip of the same octave cycled through five different timbres (Piano Accordion) ? 676&nbsp;KB |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n| style=\"width:33%;\"|\n|}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"notes\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bandoneon]]\n* [[Steirische Harmonika]]\n* [[Schwyzer?rgeli]]\n* [[Concertina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Accordions|accordions}}\n{{wikibooks|Accordion}}\n{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Accordion}}\n* [http://www.accordioncafe.com Articles,Forum,lessons,sheets,videos]\n*[http://www.goldaccordion.com Free accordion scores, music, videos, forum] GoldAccordion.com\n*[http://www.accordionradio.co.uk Accordion Radio]\n*[http://www.linkonardo.com/en/accordion/ Accordion Videos And Links]\n*[http://www.accordions.com Accordions Worldwide]\n*[[List of accordionists]]\n*Accordion museum in [[Castelfidardo]] [http://www.comune.castelfidardo.an.it/visitatore/index.php?id=50004 Museo della Fisarmonica] Comune di Castelfidardo\n*[http://www.accordion-fanatic.com Accordion Fanatic] provides useful information about accordions from accordion playing to repairing and even gifts.\n*[http://accordiontrainer.artillery.be Accordion Trainer] Is a tutoring application that teaches the [[Stradella bass system]].\n\n{{Irish music}}\n{{Musical keyboards}}\n{{Squeezebox}}\n{{Reed aerophones}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Accordion| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]'

These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\"/>\n\n==== Deduction, reasoning, problem solving ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n<!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and economics.<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n<!-- TWO IMPORTANT UNSOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nFor difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources ? most experience a \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\": the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>\n\nHuman beings solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgements rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/> AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of \"sub-symbolic\" problem solving: [[embodied agent]] approaches emphasize the importance of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] skills to higher reasoning; [[neural net]] research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill; [[#Statistical|statistical approaches to AI]] mimic the probabilistic nature of the human ability to guess.\n\n==== Knowledge representation ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts and so on that the machine knows about. The most general are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge.<ref name=\"Ontology\"/>\n\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\n\n;[[Default reasoning]] and the [[qualification problem]]: Many of the things people know take the form of \"working assumptions.\" For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n\n;The breadth of [[commonsense knowledge]]: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]?they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/> A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n;The subsymbolic form of some [[commonsense knowledge]]: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}</ref> or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gladwell|2005}}</ref> These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non-consciously and sub-symbolically.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n==== Planning ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of the available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n==== Learning ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]\'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience \'\'E\'\' with respect to some task \'\'T\'\' and some performance measure \'\'P\'\' if its performance on \'\'T\'\' as measured by \'\'P\'\' improves with experience \'\'E\'\'.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> and has been central to AI research since the field\'s inception.<ref>\n[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]]. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In [[reinforcement learning]]<ref name=\"Reinforcement learning\"/> the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of [[decision theory]], using concepts like [[utility (economics)|utility]]. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]].<ref name=\"Computational learning theory\"/>\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches were elaborated for lifelong cumulative acquisition of repertoires of novel skills by a robot, through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers, and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation.{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n==== Natural language processing (communication) ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A [[parse tree]] represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a sentence according to some [[formal grammar]].]]\n{{Main|Natural language processing}}\n\n[[Natural language processing]]<ref name=\"Natural language processing\"/> gives machines the ability to read and [[natural language understanding|understand]] the languages that humans speak. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]] (or [[text mining]]), [[question answering]]<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/>\n\nA common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing. Increases in processing speeds and the drop in the cost of data storage makes indexing large volumes of abstractions of the user\'s input much more efficient.\n\n==== Perception ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, [[tactile sensor]]s, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. [[Computer vision]]<ref name=\"Computer vision\"/> is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are [[speech recognition]],<ref name=\"Speech recognition\"/> [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] and [[object recognition]].<ref name=\"Object recognition\"/>\n\n==== Motion and manipulation ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Robotics}}\n\nThe field of [[robotics]]<ref name=\"Robotics\"/> is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> and [[motion planning|navigation]], with sub-problems of [[Robot localization|localization]] (knowing where you are, or finding out where other things are), [[robotic mapping|mapping]] (learning what is around you, building a map of the environment), and [[motion planning]] (figuring out how to get there) or path planning (going from one point in space to another point, which may involve compliant motion ? where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with an object).{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}<ref name=\"Robotic mapping\"/>\n\n==== Long-term goals ====\nAmong the long-term goals in the research pertaining to artificial intelligence are: (1) Social intelligence, (2) Creativity, and (3) General intelligence.\n\n===== Social intelligence =====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Affective computing}}\n[[File:Kismet robot at MIT Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]], a robot with rudimentary social skills{{sfn|\'\'Kismet\'\'}}]]\n\nAffective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human [[Affect (psychology)|affects]].{{sfn|Thro|1993}}{{sfn|Edelson|1991}} It is an interdisciplinary field spanning [[computer sciences]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].{{sfn|Tao|Tan|2005}} While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into [[Emotion#The James-Lange Theory|emotion]],{{sfn|James|1884}} the more modern branch of computer science originated with [[Rosalind Picard]]\'s 1995 paper{{sfn|Picard|1995}} on affective computing.<ref>{{harvnb|Kleine-Cosack|2006}}: \"The introduction of emotion to computer science was done by Pickard (sic) who created the field of affective computing.\"</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Diamond|2003}}: \"Rosalind Picard, a genial MIT professor, is the field\'s godmother; her 1997 book, Affective Computing, triggered an explosion of interest in the emotional side of computers and their users.\"</ref> A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate [[empathy]]. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them, giving an appropriate response for those emotions.\n\nEmotion and social skills<ref name=\"Emotion and affective computing\"/> play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, in an effort to facilitate [[human-computer interaction]], an intelligent machine might want to be able to \'\'display\'\' emotions?even if it does not actually experience them itself?in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.\n\n===== Creativity =====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Computational creativity}}\n\nA sub-field of AI addresses [[creativity]] both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). Related areas of computational research are [[Artificial intuition]] and Artificial thinking.\n\n===== General intelligence =====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Artificial general intelligence|AI-complete}}\n\nMany researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with \'\'general\'\' intelligence (known as [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.<ref name=\"General intelligence\"/> A few believe that [[anthropomorphic]] features like [[artificial consciousness]] or an [[artificial brain]] may be required for such a project.<ref name=\"Artificial consciousness\"/><ref name=\"Brain simulation\"/>\n\nMany of the problems above may require general intelligence to be considered solved. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like [[machine translation]] requires that the machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author\'s argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author\'s intention ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like [[machine translation]] is considered \"[[AI-complete]]\". In order to solve this particular problem, you must solve all the problems.<ref name=\"AI complete\"/>\n\n=== Approaches ===\nThere is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.<ref>[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about\" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.</ref> A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[neurology]]? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/>\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\nCan intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require \"sub-symbolic\" processing?<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/>\nJohn Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as [[synthetic intelligence]],{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=255}} a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.{{sfn|Law|1994}}{{sfn|Bach|2008}}\n\n==== Cybernetics and brain simulation ====\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]\'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI\'s immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n==== Symbolic ====\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n; Cognitive simulation: Economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.<ref name=\"AI at CMU in the 60s\"/><ref name=\"Soar\"/>\n\n; Logic-based: Unlike [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/> His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"AI at Stanford in the 60s\"/> Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].<ref name=\"AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s\"/>\n\n; \"Anti-logic\" or \"scruffy\": Researchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])<ref name=\"AI at MIT in the 60s\"/> found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions ? they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]\" (as opposed to the \"[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]\" paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and [[Stanford]]).<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/> [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]\'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Cyc\"/>\n\n; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.<ref name=\"Knowledge revolution\"/> This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.<ref name=\"Expert systems\"/> The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\n\n==== Sub-symbolic ====\nBy the 1980s progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/>\n\n; Bottom-up, [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]] or [[nouvelle AI]]: Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.<ref name=\"Embodied AI\"/> Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\n; [[Computational intelligence]] and [[soft computing]]: Interest in [[neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> Neural networks are an example of [[soft computing]] --- they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often enough. Other soft computing approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n==== Statistical ====\nIn the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly [[scientific method|scientific]], in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI\'s recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]). [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] describe this movement as nothing less than a \"revolution\" and \"the victory of the [[neats and scruffies|neats]].\"<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/> Critics argue that these techniques (with few exceptions{{sfn|Hutter|2012}}) are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}} There is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in AI, exemplified in part by exchanges between [[Peter Norvig]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].{{sfn|Katz|2012}}{{sfn|Norvig|2012}}\n\n==== Integrating the approaches ====\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works ? some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields?such as [[decision theory]] and economics?that also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a [[hybrid intelligent system]], and the study of such systems is [[artificial intelligence systems integration]]. A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> [[Rodney Brooks]]\' [[subsumption architecture]] was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.<ref name=\"Subsumption architecture\"/>\n<!--\nThis should also describe [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]] briefly.\n--->\n\n=== Tools ===\nIn the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n==== Search and optimization ====\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[:#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\" /> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Large numbers#Astronomically large numbers|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[natural selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of [[evolutionary computation]] include [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms (such as [[ant colony optimization|ant colony]] or [[particle swarm optimization]])<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/> and [[evolutionary algorithms]] (such as [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]]).<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/>\n\n==== Logic ====\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic|Propositional]] or [[sentential logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> is the logic of statements which can be true or false. [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> also allows the use of [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy logic]],<ref name=\"Fuzzy logic\"/> is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). [[Fuzzy system]]s can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer [[Pattern recognition|product control systems]]. [[Subjective logic]]<ref name=\"Subjective logic\"/> models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a [[Beta distribution]]. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.\n\n[[Default logic]]s, [[non-monotonic logic]]s and [[circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/> are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the [[qualification problem]]. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of [[knowledge representation|knowledge]], such as: [[description logic]]s;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> [[situation calculus]], [[event calculus]] and [[fluent calculus]] (for representing events and time);<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> [[Causality#Causal calculus|causal calculus]];<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> belief calculus; and [[modal logic]]s.<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/>\n\n==== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ====\n{{Main|Bayesian network|Hidden Markov model|Kalman filter|Decision theory|Utility theory}}\n\nMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/>\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\" /> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n==== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ====\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\" />\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]],<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/>\n[[naive Bayes classifier]],<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/>\nand [[decision tree learning|decision tree]].<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/>\nThe performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the \"[[No free lunch in search and optimization|no free lunch]]\" theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>\n\n==== Neural networks ====\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nThe study of [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullough]]. Other important early researchers were [[Frank Rosenblatt]], who invented the [[perceptron]] and [[Paul Werbos]] who developed the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.<ref name=\"Backpropagation\"/>\n\nThe main categories of networks are acyclic or [[feedforward neural network]]s (where the signal passes in only one direction) and [[recurrent neural network]]s (which allow feedback). Among the most popular feedforward networks are [[perceptron]]s, [[multi-layer perceptron]]s and [[radial basis network]]s.<ref name=\"Feedforward neural networks\"/> Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the [[Hopfield net]], a form of attractor network, which was first described by [[John Hopfield]] in 1982.<ref name=\"Recurrent neural networks\"/> Neural networks can be applied to the problem of [[intelligent control]] (for robotics) or [[machine learning|learning]], using such techniques as [[Hebbian learning]] and [[competitive learning]].<ref name=\"Learning in neural networks\"/>\n\n[[Hierarchical temporal memory]] is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the [[neocortex]].<ref name=\"Hierarchical temporal memory\"/> The term \"[[deep learning]]\" gained traction in the mid-2000s after a publication by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and Ruslan Salakhutdinov showed how a many-layered [[feedforward neural network]] could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[restricted Boltzmann machine]], then using [[supervised learning|supervised]] [[backpropagation]] for fine-tuning.{{sfn|Hinton|2007}}\n\n==== Deep neural networks ====\nA [[deep neural network]] is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Research|first1=AI|title=Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition|url=http://airesearch.com/ai-research-papers/deep-neural-networks-for-acoustic-modeling-in-speech-recognition/|website=airesearch.com|accessdate=23 October 2015|date=23 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Control theory ====\n{{Main|Intelligent control}}\n[[Control theory]], the grandchild of [[cybernetics]], has many important applications, especially in [[robotics]].<ref name=\"Control theory\"/>\n\n==== Languages ====\n{{Main|List of programming languages for artificial intelligence}}\n\n<!-- Not sure where to put this in the article. I think it deserves no more weight than this single sentence. To be improved. -->\nAI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]<ref name=\"Lisp\"/> and [[Prolog]].<ref name=\"Prolog\"/>\n\n=== Evaluating progress ===\n{{Main|Progress in artificial intelligence}}\nIn 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the [[Turing test]]. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.<ref name=\"Turing test\"/>\n\nArtificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed [[subject matter expert Turing test]]s. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.<ref name=\"Subject matter expert Turing test\"/>\n\nOne classification for outcomes of an AI test is:{{sfn|Rajani|2011}}\n# Optimal: it is not possible to perform better.\n# Strong super-human: performs better than all humans.\n# Super-human: performs better than most humans.\n# Sub-human: performs worse than most humans.\n\nFor example, performance at [[draughts]] (i.e. checkers) is optimal,<ref name=\"Game AI\"/> performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human (see [[Computer chess#Computers versus humans|computer chess:&nbsp;computers versus human]]) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.\n\nA quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from \'\'mathematical\'\' definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and [[data compression]].<ref name=\"Mathematical definitions of intelligence\"/> Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.\n\nA derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ([[CAPTCHA]]). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O\'Brien|Marakas|2011}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An [[automated online assistant]] providing customer service on a web page ? one of many very primitive applications of artificial intelligence.]]\n{{expand section|talksection=Todo: Applications|date=January 2011}}\n{{Main|Applications of artificial intelligence}}\n\nArtificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the [[AI effect]].{{sfn|\'\'CNN\'\'|2006}} An area that artificial intelligence has contributed greatly to is [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]].<ref name=\"Intrusion detection\" />\n\n=== Competitions and prizes ===\n{{Main|Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence}}\nThere are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, [[autonomous car|robotic cars]], robot soccer and games.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nA [[platform (computing)|platform]] (or \"[[computing platform]]\") is defined as \"some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run.\" As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago,{{sfn|Brooks|1991}} it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.\n\nA wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from [[expert systems]], albeit [[Personal Computer|PC]]-based but still an entire real-world system, to various robot platforms such as the widely available [[Roomba]] with open interface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hackingroomba.com/?s=atmel|title=Hacking Roomba|work=hackingroomba.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Toys ===\n[[AIBO]], the first robotic pet, grew out of Sony\'s Computer Science Laboratory (CSL). Famed engineer Toshitada Doi is credited as AIBO\'s original progenitor: in 1994 he had started work on robots with artificial intelligence expert Masahiro Fujita, at CSL. Doi\'s friend, the artist Hajime Sorayama, was enlisted to create the initial designs for the AIBO\'s body. Those designs are now part of the permanent collections of Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian Institution, with later versions of AIBO being used in studies in Carnegie Mellon University. In 2006, AIBO was added into Carnegie Mellon University\'s \"Robot Hall of Fame\".\n\n== Philosophy and ethics ==\n{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Ethics of artificial intelligence}}\nThere are three philosophical questions related to AI:\n#Is [[artificial general intelligence]] possible? Can a machine solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard limits to what a machine can accomplish?\n#Are intelligent machines dangerous? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?\n#Can a machine have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]] in exactly the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be [[sentient]], and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine [[intention]]ally cause harm?\n\n=== The limits of artificial general intelligence ===\n{{Main|philosophy of AI|Turing test|Physical symbol systems hypothesis|Dreyfus\' critique of AI|The Emperor\'s New Mind|AI effect}}\n\nCan a machine be intelligent? Can it \"think\"?\n\n;\'\'[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Turing\'s \"polite convention\"]]\'\': We need not decide if a machine can \"think\"; we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being. This approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the [[Turing test]].<ref name=\"Turing test\"/>\n\n;\'\'The [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth proposal]]\'\': \"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\" This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth Conference]] of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.<ref name=\"Dartmouth proposal\"/>\n\n;\'\'[[Physical symbol system|Newell and Simon\'s physical symbol system hypothesis]]\'\': \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" Newell and Simon argue that intelligence consists of formal operations on symbols.<ref name=\"Physical symbol system hypothesis\"/> [[Hubert Dreyfus]] argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a \"feel\" for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See [[Dreyfus\' critique of AI]].)<ref>\nDreyfus criticized the [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] condition of the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis, which he called the \"psychological assumption\": \"The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules\". {{Harv|Dreyfus|1992|p=156}}</ref><ref name=\"Dreyfus\' critique\"/>\n\n;\'\'G?delian arguments\'\': [[G?del]] himself,<ref name=\"G?del himself\"/> [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] (in 1961) and [[Roger Penrose]] (in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards) argued that humans are not reducible to Turing machines.<ref name=\"The mathematical objection\"/> The detailed arguments are complex, but in essence they derive from [[Kurt G?del]]\'s 1931 proof in his [[G?del\'s first incompleteness theorem|first incompleteness theorem]] that it is always possible to create [[statement (logic)|statement]]s that a [[formal system]] could not prove. A human being, however, can (with some thought) see the truth of these \"G?del statements\". Any Turing program designed to search for these statements can have its methods reduced to a formal system, and so will always have a \"G?del statement\" derivable from its program which it can never discover. However, if humans are indeed capable of understanding mathematical truth, it doesn\'t seem possible that we could be limited in the same way. This is quite a general result, if accepted, since it can be shown that hardware neural nets, and computers based on random processes (e.g. annealing approaches) and quantum computers based on entangled qubits (so long as they involve no new physics) can all be reduced to Turing machines. All they do is reduce the complexity of the tasks, not permit new types of problems to be solved. Roger Penrose speculates that there may be new physics involved in our brain, perhaps at the intersection of gravity and quantum mechanics at the [[Planck scale]]. This argument, if accepted does not rule out the possibility of true artificial intelligence, but means it has to be biological in basis or based on new physical principles. The argument has been followed up by many counter arguments, and then Roger Penrose has replied to those with counter counter examples, and it is now an intricate complex debate.<ref>[http://www.calculemus.org/MathUniversalis/NS/10/01penrose.html Beyond the Doubting of a Shadow, A Reply to Commentaries on Shadows of the Mind], Roger Penrose 1996 The links to the original articles he responds to there are easily found in the Wayback machine: [http://web.archive.org/web/20090415202652/http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-08-baars.html Can Physics Provide a Theory of Consciousness?] Barnard J.

[[Hans Moravec]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.<ref name=\"Brain simulation\"/>\n\n;\'\'The [[AI effect]]\'\': Machines are \'\'already\'\' intelligent, but observers have failed to recognize it. When [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] beat [[Garry Kasparov]] in chess, the machine was acting intelligently. However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not \"real\" intelligence after all; thus \"real\" intelligence is whatever intelligent behavior people can do that machines still can not. This is known as the AI Effect: \"AI is whatever hasn\'t been done yet.\"<!--<ref name=\"AI Effect\"/>-->\n\n=== Intelligent behaviour and machine ethics ===\nAs a minimum, an AI system must be able to reproduce aspects of human intelligence. This  raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other AI agents. This issue was addressed by Wendell Wallach in his book titled \'\'Moral Machines\'\' in which he introduced the concept of [[Moral agency#Artificial moral agents|artificial moral agents]] (AMA).<ref>Wendell Wallach (2010). \'\'Moral Machines\'\', Oxford University Press.</ref> For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"<ref>Wallach, pp 37?54.</ref> and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".<ref>Wallach, pp 55?73.</ref> For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of \'\'whether\'\' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the \'\'constraints\'\' which society may place on the development of AMAs.<ref>Wallach, Introduction chapter.</ref>\n\n==== Machine ethics ====\n{{Main|Machine ethics}}\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.</ref> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems ? it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06|title=Machine Ethics|work=aaai.org}}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\" <ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\nPolitical scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles T. Rubin|date=Spring 2003|title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature|journal=The New Atlantis|volume=1|pages=88?100|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably, because there is no \'\'a priori\'\' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft\'s Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is \'[[Friendly AI]]\', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/}}</ref>\n\n==== Devaluation of humanity ====\n{{Main|Computer Power and Human Reason}}\n[[Joseph Weizenbaum]] wrote that AI applications can not, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as [[customer service]] or [[psychotherapy]]<ref>In the early 1970s, [[Kenneth Colby]] presented a version of Weizenbaum\'s [[ELIZA]] known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=132?144}}</ref> was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as [[computationalism]]). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.<ref name=\"Weizenbaum\'s critique\"/>\n\n==== Decrease in demand for human labor ====\nMartin Ford, author of \'\'The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future\'\',<ref name=\"Ford2009Lights\">{{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}</ref> and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations?and in particular entry level jobs?will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/machine-learning-a-job-killer/|title=Machine Learning: A job killer?|work=econfuture - Robots, AI and Unemployment - Future Economics and Technology}}</ref> and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to [[Outsourcing|outsource]] [[knowledge worker|knowledge work]].<ref name=\"Replaced by machines\"/>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[sentient]] ? will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\nThere are no objective criteria for knowing whether an intelligent agent is sentient&nbsp;? that it has conscious experiences. We assume that other people do because we do and they tell us that they do, but this is only a subjective determination. The lack of any hard criteria is known as the \"hard problem\" in the theory of consciousness. The problem applies not only to other people but to the higher animals and, by extension, to AI agents.\n\n==== Computationalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nAre human intelligence, [[consciousness]] and [[mind]] products of [[information processing]]? Is the brain essentially a computer?\n\nComputationalism is the idea that \"the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing\". AI, or implementing machines with human intelligence was founded on the claim that \"a central property of humans, intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". A program can then be derived from this human computer and implemented into an artificial one to create efficient artificial intelligence. This program would act upon a set of outputs that result from set inputs of the internal memory of the computer, that is, the machine can only act with what it has implemented in it to start with. A long term goal for AI researchers is to provide machines with a deep understanding of the many abilities of a human being to replicate a general intelligence or strong AI, defined as a machine surpassing human abilities to perform the skills implanted in it, a scary thought to many, who fear losing control of such a powerful machine. Obstacles for researchers are mainly time contstraints. That is, AI scientists cannot establish much of a database for commonsense knowledge because it must be ontologically crafted into the machine which takes up a tremendous amount of time. To combat this, AI research looks to have the machine able to understand enough concepts in order to add to its own ontology, but how can it do this when machine ethics is primarily concerned with behavior of machines towards humans or other machines, limiting the extent of developing AI. In order to function like a common human AI must also display, \"the ability to solve subsymbolic commonsense knowledge tasks such as how artists can tell statues are fake or how chess masters don?t move certain spots to avoid exposure,\" but by developing machines who can do it all AI research is faced with the difficulty of potentially putting a lot of people out of work, while on the economy side of things businesses would boom from efficiency, thus forcing AI into a bottleneck trying to developing self improving machines.\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\n[[Strong AI hypothesis|Searle\'s strong AI hypothesis]] states that \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle\'s strong AI\"/> John Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look \'\'inside\'\' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\n[[Mary Shelley]]\'s \'\'[[Frankenstein]]\'\' considers a key issue in the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also \'\'[[sentience|feel]]\'\'? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern science fiction, such as the film \'\'[[A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]]\'\', in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions. This issue, now known as \"[[robot rights]]\", is currently being considered by, for example, California\'s [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.<ref name=\"Robot rights\"/> The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film \'\'[[Plug & Pray]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film - Artificial Intelligence - Robots - |author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de}}</ref>\n\n=== Superintelligence ===\n{{Main|Superintelligence}}\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines&nbsp;? or human-machine hybrids&nbsp;? can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ??Superintelligence?? may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.\n\n==== Technological singularity ====\n{{Main|Technological singularity|Moore\'s law}}\nIf research into [[artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario \"[[technological singularity|singularity]]\".<ref name=Singularity/> Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.<ref name=Singularity/>\n\n[[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore\'s law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.<ref name=Singularity/>\n\n==== Transhumanism ====\n{{Main|Transhumanism}}\n{{quote|You awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning.

Early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots. The word \"robot\" itself was coined by [[Karel ?apek]] in his 1921 play \'\'[[R.U.R.]]\'\', the title standing for \"[[Rossum\'s Universal Robots]]\". Later, the SF writer [[Isaac Asimov]] developed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories. These laws have since gained some traction in genuine AI research.\n\nOther influential fictional intelligences include [[HAL 9000|HAL]], the computer in charge of the spaceship in \'\'[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]\'\', released as both a film and a book in 1968 and written by [[Arthur C. Clarke]].\n\nSince then, AI has become firmly rooted in popular culture.\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- unused ref\n<ref name=\"TOPIO\">\n[[TOPIO]]:\n* {{Cite news|url = http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-02/ping-pong-playing-terminator|title=A Ping-Pong-Playing Terminator|publisher=Popular Science}}\n* {{Cite news|url = http://www.gadgetrivia.com/8164-best_robot_international_robot_exhibition|title=Best robot 2009|publisher=gadgetrivia.com}}{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n-->\n\n<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------>\n\n<ref name=\"Definition of AI\">\nDefinition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]]:\n* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article.

In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldrecords.com/news/afro-celt-sound-system-return-to-the-home-where-they-were-launched-in-1995-the-womad-festival |title=News ?

While making an album with Maal in Senegal, Emmerson was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air. Back in London, Irish musician [[Davy Spillane]] told Emmerson about a belief that nomadic Celts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe. Whether or not the theory was true, Emmerson was intrigued by the two countries\' musical affinities.\n\nIn an experiment that would prove successful, Emmerson brought two members of Baaba Maal\'s band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create. Adding a dash of modern sound, Emmerson also brought in English dance mixers for an electronic beat. \"People thought I was mad when I touted the idea,\" Emmerson told Jim Carroll of \'\'[[The Irish Times]]\'\'. \"At the time, I was out of favour with the London club scene. I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary\".{{full|date=November 2012}}\n\nJamming in the studios at Real World, musician Peter Gabriel\'s recording facilities in [[Wiltshire, England]], the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week. This album, \'\'[[Volume 1: Sound Magic]]\'\', was released by Real World Records in 1996, and marked the debut of the Afro Celt Sound System, an energetic global fusion the likes of which the music world had not yet seen.\n\n\"Prior to that first album being made, none of us knew if it would work,\" musician James McNally told Larry Katz of the Boston Herald. \"We were strangers who didn\'t even speak the same language. But we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language.\"{{full|date=November 2012}} McNally, who grew up second-generation Irish in London, played whistles, keyboards, piano, [[bodhran]], and bamboo flute.\n\n\'\'Sound Magic\'\' has now sold over 300,000 copies. The band performed at festivals, raves, and dance clubs and regularly included two African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drum and djembe and [[N\'Faly Kouyate]] on vocals, [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] and [[balafon]].\n\nJust as the second album was getting off the ground, one of the group\'s core musicians, 27-year-old [[keyboardist]] [[Jo Bruce]] (son of [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bass player [[Jack Bruce]]), died suddenly of an [[asthma]] attack. The band was devastated, and the album was put on hold. Then Irish pop star [[Sin?ad O\'Connor]] came to the rescue, collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss. \"[O\'Connor] blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful,\" McNally told Katz. \"We had this track we didn\'t know what to do with. Sin?ad scribbled a few lyrics and bang! She left us completely choked up.\"{{full|date=November 2012}} So taken was the band with O\'Connor\'s song, \"Release,\" that they used the name for the title of their album. \'\'[[Volume 2: Release]]\'\' hit the music stores in 1999, and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2000 the group was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best World Music category. The band, composed at the time of eight members from six countries (England, [[Senegal]], Guinea, Ireland, France and [[Kenya]]), took pride in its ability to bring people together through music. \"We can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we\'re at home,\" McNally told Patrick MacDonald of [[The Seattle Times]]\'\'. \"We\'re breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music. We leave a door open to communicate with each other\'s traditions. And it\'s changed our lives\".{{full|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn 2001 the group released \'\'[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]\'\', which climbed to number one on Billboard\'s Top World Music Albums chart. Featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and [[Robert Plant]], the album also incorporated a heightened African sound. \"On the first two records, the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic, London club side of the equation,\" Emmerson told the Irish Times\'s Carroll. \"For this one, we wanted to have more African vocals and input than we\'d done before.\"{{full|date=November 2012}} Again the Afro Celt Sound System met with success. Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised the album as \"a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music.\"{{full|date=November 2012}} The single \"[[When You\'re Falling]]\", with vocals by Gabriel, became a radio hit in the United States.\n\nIn 2003, for the \'\'[[Seed]]\'\' album, they temporarily changed their name to the simpler \'\'\'Afrocelts\'\'\'; this was subsequently regarded as a mistake, and they reverted to the longer and more familiar band name for their subsequent albums, \'\'[[Pod (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Pod]]\'\', a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, \'\'[[Volume 5: Anatomic]]\'\' (their fifth studio album), and \'\'[[Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010]]\".\n\nThey played a number of shows to promote \'\'Volume 5: Anatomic\'\' in 2006 and summer 2007, ending with a gig in Korea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrocelts.org/wst_page9.html |title=Afro Celt Sound System Fan Website - ACSS News |publisher=Afrocelts.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> before taking an extended break to work on side projects, amongst them \'\'[[The Imagined Village]]\'\' featuring Simon Emmerson and Johnny Kalsi. Starting in the summer of 2010, the band performed a series of live shows to promote a new 2-CD album, \'\'[[Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010]]\'\', released on 6 September 2010 on Real World Records. Further performances continue to the present day, and a new album-in-progress titled \'\'Born\'\' was announced on their website in 2014.\n\n==Band members==\n\nWhen Afro Celt Sound System began their musical journey in the mid-1990s during the [[Real World Records|Real World]] Recording Week, the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non-existent. However, over time, a combination of people became most often associated with the name Afro Celt Sound System (while \'\'Volume 5: Anatomic\'\' only lists Emmerson, McNally, ? Lion?ird and Russell as regulars):\n\n# [[Simon Emmerson]] ([[guitar]], production)\n# [[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] ([[Tin whistle|whistle]], [[Keyboards]], [[bodhr?n]], [[accordion]], production)\n# [[N\'Faly Kouyate]] ([[kora (instrument)|kora]], [[Balafon|balaphon]], vocals)\n# [[Ian Markin]] (acoustic and electronic drums)\n# [[Babara Bangoura]] ([[djembe]], [[talking drum]])\n# [[Dav Daheley]] ([[dhol]], [[tabla]], percussion)\n# [[Jimmy Mahon]] ([[uillean pipes]], [[tin whistle]], [[flute]])\n# [[Demba Barry]] (Senegalese dancing)\n# [[Martin Russell]] (keyboards, producing, engineering, programming)\n\nOther musicians who have performed with Afro Celt Sound System include: [[Iarla ?

'Ancient_philosophy'	'{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}\n\n{{histphil}}\nThis page lists some links to \'\'\'ancient philosophy\'\'\'. In [[Western philosophy]], the spread of [[Christianity]] in the [[Roman Empire]] marked the ending of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]], whereas in [[Eastern philosophy]], the [[spread of Islam]] through the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] marked the end of [[#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]] and ushered in the beginnings of [[early Islamic philosophy]].\n\n==Introduction==\nGenuinely philosophical thought, depending upon original individual insights, arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously. [[Karl Jaspers]] termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century BCE an [[Axial Age]] in human thought.\n\n==Ancient Chinese philosophy==\n{{Main|Chinese philosophy}}\nChinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in China and other countries within the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] that [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture|share a common language]], including Japan, [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Schools of thought===\n\n====Hundred Schools of Thought====\n{{main|Hundred Schools of Thought}}\nThe Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BCE,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112694/Chinese-philosophy#ref171469 \"Chinese philosophy\"], Encyclopaedia Britannica, accessed 4/6/2014</ref> an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China. Even though this period ? known in its earlier part as the [[Spring and Autumn]] period and the [[Warring States]] period ? in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it is also known as the Golden Age of [[Chinese philosophy]] because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s and [[social consciousness]] up to the present day in East Asian countries. The [[intellectual]] society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of [[government]], [[war]], and [[diplomacy]]. This period ended with the rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]] and the subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge]] of dissent. The [[Book of Han]] lists ten major schools, they are:\n* [[Confucianism]], which teaches that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. A main idea of Confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection. Confucianism holds that one should give up one\'s life, if necessary, either passively or actively, for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of \'\'[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]\'\' and \'\'[[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]]\'\'.<ref>{{citation|url=http://arts.hkbu.edu.hk/~pclo/e5.pdf|author=Lo, Ping-cheung|title=Confucian Ethic of Death with Dignity and Its Contemporary Relevance|year=1999|publisher=Society of Christian Ethics}}</ref>\n* [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which maintained that human nature was incorrigibly selfish; accordingly, the only way to preserve the social order was to impose discipline from above, and to see to a strict enforcement of laws. The Legalists exalted the state above all, seeking its prosperity and martial prowess over the welfare of the common people.\n* [[Taoism]], a philosophy which emphasizes the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Jewels of the Tao]]: [[compassion]], [[moderation]], and [[humility]], while Taoist thought generally focuses on [[nature]], the relationship between humanity and the cosmos; [[health]] and [[longevity]]; and [[wu wei]] (action through inaction). Harmony with the [[Universe]], or the source thereof (Tao), is the intended result of many Taoist rules and practices.\n* [[Mohism]], which advocated the idea of universal love: Mozi believed that \"everyone is equal before heaven\", and that people should seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love. His epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist [[empiricism]]; he believed that human cognition ought to be based on one\'s perceptions &ndash; one\'s sensory experiences, such as sight and hearing &ndash; instead of imagination or internal logic, elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction. Mozi advocated frugality, condemning the Confucian emphasis on ritual and music, which he denounced as extravagant.\n* Naturalism, the [[School of Naturalists]] or the Yin-yang school, which synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]];  [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclop?dia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref>\n* Agrarianism, or the [[School of Agrarianism]], which advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot | author2  = Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> The Agrarians believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king [[Shen Nong]], a folk hero which was portrayed in Chinese literature as \"working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached.\"<ref name=\"wp\" />\n* The [[School of Names|Logicians]] or the School of Names, which focused on [[definition]] and [[logic]]. It is said to have parallels with that of the Ancient Greek [[sophists]] or [[dialectician]]s. The most notable Logician was [[Gongsun Longzi]].\n* The [[School of Diplomacy]] or School of Vertical and Horizontal [Alliances], which focused on practical matters instead of any moral principle, so it stressed political and diplomatic tactics, and debate and lobbying skill. Scholars from this school were good orators, debaters and tacticians.\n* The Miscellaneous School, which integrated teachings from different schools; for instance, [[L? Buwei]] found scholars from different schools to write a book called [[L?shi Chunqiu]] cooperatively. This school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws.\n* The School of \"Minor-talks\", which was not a unique school of thought, but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street.\n* Another group is the School of the Military that studied strategy and the [[philosophy of war]]; [[Sunzi]] and [[Sun Bin]] were influential leaders. However, this school was not one of the \"Ten Schools\" defined by Hanshu.\n\n====Early Imperial China====\nThe founder of the [[Qin Dynasty]], who implemented Legalism as the official philosophy, [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|quashed Mohist and Confucianist schools]]. Legalism remained influential until the emperors of the [[Han Dynasty]] adopted Daoism and later Confucianism as official doctrine. These latter two became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of Buddhism.\n\nConfucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest [[Intellectual|thinker]] was [[Dong Zhongshu]], who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination \'\'Old Text\'\') that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the \'\'[[Xuanxue]]\'\' (mysterious learning), also called \'\'Neo-Taoism\'\'. The most important philosophers of this movement were [[Wang Bi]], [[Xiang Xiu]] and [[Guo Xiang]]. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, \'\'ming\'\' and \'\'wuming\'\'). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], was the concept of \'\'[[feng liu]]\'\' (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.\n\n[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|Northern and Southern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about [[Laozi]], founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to [[Buddha]]. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was far more successful in China than its rival [[Hinayana]], and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were [[Sengzhao]] and [[Daosheng]]. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the [[Zen]] sect.\n\n===Philosophers===\n* [[Taoism]]\n** [[Laozi]] (5th?4th century BCE)\n** [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] (4th century BCE)\n** [[Zhang Daoling]]\n** [[Zhang Jue]] (died 184 CE)\n** [[Ge Hong]] (283 ?

In the famous [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] \'\'[[Hymn of Creation]]\'\' ([[Nasadiya Sukta]]) the poet says:\n[[File:Sanjayas\'s Foreknowledge.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Vyasa]], at middle of the picture]]\n: \"Whence all creation had its origin,\n: he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,\n: he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,\n: he knows?or maybe even he does not know.\"\n\nIn the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (\'\'Purusha\'\'). This leads to the inquiry into \'\'the one being\'\' that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed \'\'rta\'\' and causal law by \'\'karma\'\'. Nature (\'\'prakriti\'\') is taken to have three qualities (\'\'[[sattva]]\'\', \'\'[[rajas]]\'\', and \'\'[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]\'\').\n* [[Vedas]]\n* [[Upanishads]]\n* [[Hindu philosophy]]\n\n===Sramana philosophy===\n{{main|Jain philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Sramana}}\n[[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. [[C?rv?ka]] (Sanskrit: ???????) (atheist) philosophy,  also known as Lok?yata, it is a system of Hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is named after its founder, C?rv?ka, author of the B?rhaspatya-s?tras.\n\n===Classical Indian philosophy===\nIn classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. Some of the questions asked were:\n* What is the ontological nature of consciousness?\n* How is cognition itself experienced?\n* Is mind (\'\'chit\'\') intentional or not?\n* Does cognition have its own structure?\n\nThe Six schools of [[Indian philosophy]] are:\n* [[Nyaya]]\n* [[Vaisheshika]]\n* [[Samkhya]]\n* [[R?ja yoga|Yoga]]\n* [[Mimamsa]] (Purva Mimamsa)\n* [[Vedanta]] (Uttara Mimamsa)\n\n===Ancient Indian philosophers===\n{{main|Timeline of Eastern philosophers#Indian philosophers}}\n\n====3rd millennium - 2nd millennium BCE====\n* [[Parashara]] &mdash; writer of [[Vishnu Purana|Vi??u Pur??a]].\n* [[Vyasa]] &mdash; author of  the [[Mahabharata]], as well as a character in it.\n\n====Philosophers of Vedic Age (2000?600 BCE)====\n* Rishi Narayana &mdash; seer of the Purusha Sukta of the [[Rig Veda]].<ref>The significance of Purusha Sukta in [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pur.html Daily Invocations] by Swami Krishnananda</ref>\n* [[Saptarishi|Seven Rishis]] &mdash; Atri, Bharadwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kasyapa, Vasishtha, Viswamitra.<ref>P. 285 \'\'Indian sociology through Ghurye, a dictionary\'\' By S.

London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 403.</ref> a city of [[Ionia]] (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the [[Milesian school]] and learned the teachings of his master [[Thales]]. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and, arguably, [[Pythagoras]] amongst his pupils.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.de/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=Porphyry%2C+Life+of+Pythagoras+Anaximander|title=Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras Anaximander}}</ref>\n\nLittle of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies,<ref>[[Themistius]], \'\'Oratio\'\' 36, ?317</ref> although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.\n\nHe was an early proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.<ref>Park, David (2005) \'\'The Grand Contraption\'\', Princeton University Press ISBN 0-691-12133-8</ref> Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander\'s contributions to [[philosophy]] relate to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], he tried to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Anaximander.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Detail of [[Raphael]]\'s painting \'\'[[The School of Athens]]\'\', 1510?1511.

See http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/SchoolAthens2.htm for a description of the characters in this painting.</ref>]]\n\nAnaximander, son of Praxiades, was born in the third year of the 42nd [[Olympiad]] (610 BC).<ref name=\"Refutation\">[[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] (?), \'\'[[Refutation of All Heresies]]\'\' (I, 5)</ref> According to [[Apollodorus of Athens]], Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547?546&nbsp;BC), and died shortly afterwards.<ref>In his \'\'Chronicles\'\', as reported by [[Diogenes La?rtius]], \'\'[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]\'\' (II, 2).</ref>\n\nEstablishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. [[Themistius]], a 4th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[rhetoric]]ian, mentions that he was the \"first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.\" Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in [[prose]], at least in the Western world. By the time of [[Plato]], his philosophy was almost forgotten, and [[Aristotle]], his successor [[Theophrastus]] and a few [[Doxography|doxographers]] provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales\' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the Monist school which began in Miletus with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]].<ref>Richard D. McKirahan, \'\'Philosophy before Socrates\'\', Ch 5, 32?34</ref>  3rd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. Indeed, \'\'Various History\'\' (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony?s allegiance.\n\n==Theories==\nAnaximander\'s theories were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition, and by some ideas of [[Thales]]&nbsp;? the father of philosophy&nbsp;? as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the East{{Dubious|date=October 2012}} (especially by the Babylonian astrologers).<ref>C. Mosse (1984) \'\'La Grece archaique d\' Homere a Eschyle\'\'. Edition du Seuil. p236</ref> All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, therefore they could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.<ref>C. M. Bowra (1957) \'\'The Greek experience\'\'. World publishing Company. Cleveland and New York. p168,169.</ref>\n\nSome scholars saw a gap between the existing mythical and the new [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek [[city states]].<ref>[[Herbert Ernest Cushman]] claims Anaximander has \"the first European philosophical conception of god\", \'\'A beginner\'s history of philosophy\'\', Volume 1 pg. 24</ref> Because of this, they did not hesitate to speak for a \"Greek miracle\". But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander\'s ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]) which the first Greek philosophers believed that constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old cosmogonies&nbsp;? [[Hesiod]] (8th&nbsp;? 7th century&nbsp;BC) and [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] (6th century BC)&nbsp;? [[Zeus]] establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony, (the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]]). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not [[monarchic]] but [[geometric]] and this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature.<ref>C. Mosse (1984) \'\'La Grece archaique d\'Homere a Eschyle\'\'. Edition du Seuil. p 235</ref> In this space there is \'\'isonomy\'\' (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable.

He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term \'\'[[Arche|arch?]]\'\' ({{lang|grc|????}}), which until then had meant beginning or origin. For him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea) and as in [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to apeiron) i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.

While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element ([[water (classical element)|water]] for Thales and [[air (classical element)|air]] for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (\'\'apeiron\'\'), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived.<ref>[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], \'\'The Doctrines of the Philosophers\'\' (I, 3).</ref> He proposed the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and Anaximander\'s description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This arche is called \"eternal and ageless\". (Hippolytus (?), \'\'Refutation\'\', I,6,I;DK B2)<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&pg|isbn=978-0-521-29420-1|page=83}}</ref>\n\nFor Anaximander, the [[Principle (chemistry)|principle]] of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales\' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth.<ref>[[Aristotle]], \'\'[[On Generation and Corruption]]\'\' (II, 5)</ref> Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature ? for example, water can only be wet, never dry ? and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the \'\'apeiron\'\' as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.\n\nAnaximander explains how the [[Classical element|four elements]] of ancient physics ([[air (classical element)|air]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood (e.g., by Aristotle and by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]) as a sort of primal [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. According to him, the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in \"all the worlds\" (for he believed there were many).\n\nAnaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came (\'\'apeiron\'\'). The one surviving fragment of Anaximander\'s writing deals with this matter. Simplicius transmitted it as a quotation, which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements:<ref>[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], \'\'Comments on Aristotle\'s Physics\'\' (24, 13):\n\n: \"{{lang|grc|????????????

Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius\' own interpretation, {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  but Anaximander\'s writing, in \"somewhat poetic terms\" as it is mentioned by Simplicius.</ref><ref>Curd, Patricia, \'\'A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia\'\' ([[Hackett Publishing]], 1996), p. 12.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhence things have their origin,<br />\nThence also their destruction happens,<br />\nAccording to necessity;<br />\nFor they give to each other justice and recompense<br />\nFor their injustice<br />\nIn conformity with the ordinance of Time.\n</blockquote>\n\nSimplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these \"in poetic terms\", meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]) keeps the cosmic order.\nThis concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle,<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Metaphysics\'\', I, 3, 983 \'\'b\'\' 8?11; \'\'[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]\'\', III, 5, 204 \'\'b\'\' 33?34</ref> and by the Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]]: \"what comes from earth must return to earth.\"<ref>Euripides\'\'[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|Supplices]]\'\', v. 532</ref>  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his \'\'[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]\'\', stated that Anaximander viewed \"... all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance.\"<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], \'\'[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]\'\' (1873) ? 4.</ref> Physicist [[Max Born]], in commenting upon [[Werner Heisenberg]]\'s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of [[quantum mechanics]] are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same ?primordial substance,?\' proposed that this primordial substance be called \'\'apeiron\'\'.<ref>{{cite web \n|url= http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&pg=PA546&lpg=PA546&dq=Heisenberg+thus+arrived+at+the+idea+that+the+elementary+particles+are+to+be+seen+as+different+manifestations,+different+quantum+states,+of+one+and+the+same+%E2%80%9Cprimordial+substance.%E2%80%9D+The+elementary+particles,+it+would+follow,+are+the+only+possible+manifestations+of+matter.+Because+of+its+similarity+to+the+primordial+substance+hypothesized+by+Anaximander,+Born+called+this+substance+apeiron.&source=bl&ots=u4aEoYJT7o&sig=Nx7Mg5C0DcS1hvEuQ7q4RiqRT7M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2H-6UJqHFpDIrQfrqoGoBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Heisenberg%20thus%20arrived%20at%20the%20idea%20that%20the%20elementary%20particles%20are%20to%20be%20seen%20as%20different%20manifestations%2C%20different%20quantum%20states%2C%20of%20one%20and%20the%20same%20%E2%80%9Cprimordial%20substance.%E2%80%9D%20The%20elementary%20particles%2C%20it%20would%20follow%2C%20are%20the%20only%20possible%20manifestations%20of%20matter.%20Because%20of%20its%20similarity%20to%20the%20primordial%20substance%20hypothesized%20by%20Anaximander%2C%20Born%20called%20this%20substance%20apeiron.&f=false\n|title= A Cultural History of Physics\n|last= K?roly \n|first= Simonyi|authorlink= Simonyi K?roly\n|date= April 7, 2012\n|work=  Chapter 5.5.10 \'\'Back to the Apeiron?\'\'\n|publisher= googlebooks\n|accessdate=  July 9, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmology===\n[[Image:Anaximander cosmology-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of Anaximander\'s universe]]\n\nAnaximander\'s bold use of non-[[Greek mythology|mythological]] explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as [[Hesiod]]. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demythify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the [[Universe]] and the origins of [[life]]; for this he is often called the \"Father of [[Cosmology]]\" and founder of astronomy. However, [[pseudo-Plutarch]] states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch, \'\'Doctrines of the Philosophers\'\', i. 7</ref>\n\nAnaximander was the first to conceive a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] model of the [[world]]. In his model, the [[Earth]] floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains \"in the same place because of its indifference\", a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in \'\'[[On the Heavens]]\'\'.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'On the Heavens\'\', ii, 13</ref> Its curious shape is that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]<ref>\"A column of stone\", [[A?tius (theologian)|Aetius]] reports in \'\'De Fide\'\' (III, 7, 1), or \"similar to a pillar-shaped stone\", pseudo-Plutarch (III, 10).</ref> with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.\n\nAnaximander\'s realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking.<ref>Carlo Rovelli, \"The First Scientist, Anaximander and his Legacy\" (Yardley: Westholme, 2011).</ref><ref>Daniel W. Graham, \"Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy\" (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006).</ref> Karl Popper calls this idea \"one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking.\"<ref>Karl Popper, \"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge\" (New York: Routledge, 1998), pg 186.</ref>  Such a model allowed the concept that [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy.\n\n[[Image:Persectives of Anaximander\'s universe.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Anaximander\'s models of the universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter.]]\n\nAt the origin, after the separation of [[Temperature|hot and cold]], a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the [[Sun]] was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the [[Occultation|occlusion]] of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources)<ref>In \'\'Refutation\'\', it is reported that the circle of the Sun is twenty-seven times bigger than the Moon.</ref> and the [[Moon|lunar]] wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining [[lunar phase]]s. The [[star]]s and the [[planet]]s, located closer,<ref>Aetius, \'\'De Fide\'\' (II, 15, 6)</ref> followed the same model.<ref>Most of Anaximander\'s model of the Universe comes from pseudo-Plutarch (II, 20?28):\n\n: \"[The Sun] is a circle twenty-eight times as big as the Earth, with the outline similar to that of a fire-filled chariot wheel, on which appears a mouth in certain places and through which it exposes its fire, as through the hole on a flute. [...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and on which it\'s born is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] [The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. [...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all filled with fire, like that of the Sun\".</ref>\n\nAnaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]]. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[Zodiac]] as the Roman philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] reports in \'\'[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]\'\' (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term [[ecliptic]], but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The [[doxography|doxographer]] and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.\n\n===Multiple worlds===\nAccording to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the plurality of [[world]]s, similar to [[atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later philosopher [[Epicurus]]. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal, \"for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction\".<ref>Simplicius, \'\'Commentary on Aristotle\'s Physics\'\', 1121, 5?9</ref>\n\nIn addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus<ref>Hippolytus (?), \'\'Refutation\'\' I, 6</ref> reports Anaximander\'s claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within,<ref>Notably pseudo-Plutarch (III, 2) and Aetius, (I, 3, 3; I, 7, 12; II, 1, 3; II, 1, 8).</ref> which are often infinite in quantity). [[Cicero]] writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.<ref>\'\'On the Nature of the Gods\'\' (I, 10, 25):\n\n: \'\'\"Anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque innumerabiles esse mundos.\"\'\'\n: \"For Anaximander, gods were born, but the time is long between their birth and their death; and the worlds are countless.\"</ref>\n\nThis theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the [[Timeline of Western philosophers#Classical philosophers|timeline of the Greek history of thought]], some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]]), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous (Anaximenes, Heraclitus, [[Empedocles]] and [[Diogenes Apolloniates|Diogenes]]).\n\n===Meteorological phenomena===\nAnaximander attributed some phenomena, such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 3):\n\n: \"Anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind, for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud, then by its subtlety and lightness, the rupture produces the sound; and the scattering, because of the darkness of the cloud, creates the light.\"</ref> In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.<ref>According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], \'\'Naturales quaestiones\'\' (II, 18).</ref>\n\nHe saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 16)</ref> A part of that mass evaporated under the sun\'s action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant.<ref>It is then very likely that by observing the moon and the tides, Anaximander thought the latter were the cause, and not the effect of the satellite\'s movement.</ref> He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun.<ref name=\"Refutation\" /> For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle\'s \'\'[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]\'\' (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.\n\n===Origin of humankind===\nAnaximander speculated about the beginnings and [[Evolution|origin]] of animal life. Taking into account the existence of fossils {{Dubious|date=December 2015}}, he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and break.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (V, 19)</ref> As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer [[Censorinus]] reports:\n\n{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.<ref>Censorinus, \'\'De Die Natali\'\', IV, 7</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nAnaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth\'s climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales.<ref>[[Plutarch]] also mentions Anaximander\'s theory that humans were born inside fish, feeding like sharks, and that when they could defend themselves, they were thrown ashore to live on dry land.</ref> He thought that, considering humans\' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.\n\n==Other accomplishments==\n\n===Cartography===\n[[Image:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Possible rendering of Anaximander\'s world map<ref>According to John Mansley Robinson, \'\'An Introduction to Early Greek Philosophy\'\', Houghton and Mifflin, 1968.</ref>]]\n\nBoth [[Strabo]] and [[Agathemerus]] (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer [[Eratosthenes]], Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after [[Homer]].\n\nMaps were produced in ancient times, also notably in [[Egypt]], [[Lydia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Babylon]]. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet [[Babylonian Map of the World|BM 92687]] later than 9th century BCE but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander\'s innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.\n\nSuch an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons.<ref>As established by Marcel Conche, \'\'Anaximandre. Fragments et t?moignages\'\', introduction (p.&nbsp;43?47).</ref> First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between [[Miletus]]\'s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, [[Thales]] would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian [[Polis|city-states]] to join in a federation in order to push the [[Medes|Median]] threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.\n\nSurely aware of the sea\'s convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or ?navel? of the world ({{lang|grc|??????? ???}} \'\'omphal?s g?s\'\') could have been [[Delphi]], but is more likely in Anaximander\'s time to have been located near Miletus. The [[Aegean Sea]] was near the map\'s centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. [[Europe]] was bordered on the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was separated from [[Asia]] by the Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]], and, further east, either by the [[Rioni River|Phasis River]] (now called the Rioni) or the [[Tanais]]. The [[Nile]] flowed south into the ocean, separating [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (which was the name for the part of the then-known [[Africa]]n continent) from Asia.\n\n===Gnomon===\nThe \'\'[[Suda]]\'\' relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in [[Greece]] of the gnomon. In [[Lacedaemon]], he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of [[sundial]]s to indicate [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.<ref>These accomplishments are often attributed to him, notably by Diogenes Laertius (II, 1) and by the Roman historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], \'\'[[Preparation for the Gospel]]\'\' (X, 14, 11).</ref> Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.\n\nIn his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip?s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.\n\nThe invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the [[Babylonia]]ns. It is they, according to [[Herodotus]]\' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the \'\'Suda\'\' seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.\n\n===Prediction of an earthquake===\nIn his philosophical work [[De Divinatione]] (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of [[Lacedaemon]] to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml \'\'Da Divinatione\'\' (in Latin)]</ref> The city collapsed when the top of the [[Taygetus]] split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an \"admirable inspiration\", as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination.\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[Bertrand Russell]] in the \'\'[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]\'\' interprets Anaximander\'s theories as <!-- the above quote as | CLARIFY: probably due to editing, the quote referenced here is unclear. --> an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist.<ref>Bertrand Russell, \'\'A History of Western Philosophy and Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day\'\' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1946).</ref> His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate.\n\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in \'\'[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]\'\', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed \"...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance\". (\'\'Ibid.\'\', ? 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, \'\'Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\'\' (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1962).</ref>\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]] lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled \"Anaximander\'s Saying\" which was subsequently included in \'\'Off the Beaten Track\'\'. The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or \'\'[[Dasein]]\'\' in the context of the Anaximander fragment.<ref>Martin Heidegger, \'\'Off the Beaten Track\'\' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).</ref> Heidegger\'s lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].<ref>Cf.

To \'\'practice architecture\'\' means to provide services in connection with the design and construction of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.<!--Removed bit about \'human use\' as obvious in most architectural work, except for animal shelters, zoos, etc.--><ref name=ns.ca>http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm</ref> Etymologically, \'\'architect\'\' derives from the Latin \'\'architectus\'\', which derives from the Greek \'\' (\'\'arkhi-\'\', chief + \'\'tekton\'\', builder), i.e., \'\'\'chief builder\'\'\'.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect Online Etymology of the term \"architect\"]</ref>\n\nProfessionally, an architect\'s decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a \'\'practicum\'\' (or \'\'internship\'\') for practical experience to earn a [[Profession|license]] to practice [[architecture]]. Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction (see below).\n\nThe terms \'\'\'architect\'\'\' and \'\'\'architecture\'\'\' are also used in the disciplines of [[landscape architecture]], [[naval architecture]] and often [[information technology]] (for example a network architect or [[software architect]]). In most jurisdictions, the professional and commercial uses of the terms \"architect\"<ref><http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/8D62C73D8515D8B3482575EF00046EA6/$FILE/CAP_408_e_b5.pdf>\n</ref> and \"landscape architect\" are legally protected.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|History of Architecture}}\nThroughout ancient and medieval history, most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s?such as stone [[masonry|mason]]s and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of master builder. Until modern times there was no clear distinction between architect and [[Civil engineering|engineer]]. In Europe, the titles \'\'architect\'\' and \'\'engineer\'\' were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&pgis=1 \'\'The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance\'\'] Jacob Burckhardt ISBN 0-8052-1082-2</ref><ref>http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined</ref>\n\nIt is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional \'gentleman\' architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century, but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600. The availability of both allowed pre-construction drawings to be made by professionals.<ref name=\"MAD 225\">{{cite book|last=Pacey|first=Arnold|title=Medieval Architectural Drawing|year=2007|publisher=Tempus Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4404-8|pages=225?227}}</ref> Concurrently, the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three-dimensional building in two dimensions, together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy, helped building designers communicate their ideas.<ref name=\"MAD 225\" /> However, the development was gradual. Until the 18th century buildings continued to be designed and set-out by craftsmen, with the exception of high status projects.<ref name=\"MAD 225\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Masaccio, cappella brancacci, san pietro in cattedra. ritratto di filippo brunelleschi.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi]] is revered to be one of the most inventive and gifted architects in history.<ref>[http://totallyhistory.com/filippo-brunelleschi Filippo Brunelleschi], Totally History</ref>]]\nIn most developed countries, only qualified people with appropriate license, certification, or registration with a relevant body, often governmental may legally practice architecture. Such licensure usually requires an accredited university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. The use of terms and titles, and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as \'\'[[architectural designer]]\'\' are not legally protected.\n\nTo practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term \'\'[[building design]] professional\'\' (or \'\'Design professional)\'\', by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as [[engineering]] professionals, or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as \'\'[[architectural technologist]]s\'\' and \'\'[[intern architect]]s\'\'. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures.\n\n==Practice==\nIn the architectural profession, technical and environmental knowledge, design and construction management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. However, design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.\n\n===Design role===\n[[File:Rem Koolhaas SCL.jpg|thumb|300px|Architect [[Rem Koolhaas]] inspecting a model of the [[Seattle Central Library]]]]\nThe architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. Often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning, entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking. The architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief. The program or brief is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner ? it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.\n\nIt is generally expected that the design proposal(s) is both imaginative as well as pragmatic, but the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary, depending on the place, time, finance, culture and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place.\n\nDesign of buildings is a very complex and demanding undertaking, no matter what the scale of the project might be. A strong degree of foresight is a prerequisite. Any design concept must at a very early stage in its generation take into account a great number of issues and variables, which include qualities of space(s),<ref>https://www.academia.edu/2061334/Space_The_undefinable_space_of_architecture</ref> the end-use and life-cycle of these proposed spaces, connections, relations and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality. Selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which may occur later. The site and its environs, as well as the culture and history of the place will also influence the design. The design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of [[mathematics and architecture]], new or current [[architectural theory]], or references to [[architectural history]].\n\nA key part of design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. The control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as BIM (Building Information Management), CAD and cloud-based technologies.\n\nAt all times in the design, the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations, introducing a further variable into the design.\n\nArchitects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows) and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of current design, and in many jurisdictions design reports and records are required, which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.\n\n===Means of design===\n\nPreviously, architects employed drawings<ref name=\"MAD 225\"/> to illustrate and generate  design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects,<ref>http://www.archdaily.com/639533/17-napkin-sketches-by-famous-architects</ref> computer technology has now become the industry standard.<ref>http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html</ref> However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, lino-cuts and other media in design production. \nIncreasingly, computer software such as [[BIM]] is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building\'s design, construction and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1|title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States - National BIM Standard - United States|publisher=Nationalbimstandard.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental role===\nAs current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations which are continually tightening. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use.<ref>http://passipedia.org/basics/what_is_a_passive_house</ref>\nHowever, the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense, such as making provision for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air-conditioning, pollution and waste management, use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future.\n\n===Construction role===\nAs the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of building are continually advancing, which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.\n\nDepending on the client\'s needs and the jurisdiction\'s requirements, the spectrum of the architect\'s services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions).\n\nArchitects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]], facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement, which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect\'s access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty, which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.\n\nThe architect will typically review [[General contractor|contractor]] [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions.\n\n===Alternate practice and specializations===\nRecent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, health care, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as [[building code]], [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], [[historic preservation]](US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.\n\nMany architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], [[construction management]], [[interior design]] or other related fields.\n\n==Professional requirements==\n{{Main|Professional requirements for architects}}\n{{See also|Architectural engineering#Architect}}\n\nAlthough there are variations from place to place, most of the world\'s architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.\n\nEducational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.\n\nProfessionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]], or [[wikt:surveyor|surveyor]],{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.\n\n==Professional title distinctions==\nAccording to the [[American Institute of Architects]],<ref>[http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf \"http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf\"]</ref> titles and job descriptions within American architectural offices might be as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n!Definition\n|-\n| Senior Principal / Partner\n|Typically an owner or majority shareholder of the firm; may be the founder; titles may include managing director, president, chief executive officer, or managing principal/partner.\n|-\n| Mid-level Principal / Partner\n|Principal or partner; titles may include executive or senior vice president or director.\n|-\n| Junior Principal / Partner\n|Recently made a partner or principal of the firm; title may include vice president or associate director.\n|-\n|Department head / Senior Manager\n|Senior management architect or non-registered graduate; responsible for major department(s) or functions; reports to a principal or partner.\n|-\n|Project Manager\n|Licensed architect, or non-registered graduate with more than 10 years of experience; has overall project management responsibility for a variety of projects or project teams, including client contact, scheduling, and budgeting.\n|-\n|Senior Architect / Designer\n|Licensed architect, or non-registered graduate with more than 10 years of experience; has a design or technical focus and is responsible for significant project activities.\n|-\n|Architect / Designer III\n|Licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 8?10 years of experience; responsible for significant aspects of projects.\n|-\n|Architect / Designer II\n|Licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 6?8 years of experience, responsible for daily design or technical development of projects.\n|-\n|Architect / Designer I\n|Recently licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 3?5 years of experience; responsible for particular parts of a project within parameters set by others.\n|-\n|[[Intern Architect]]\n|Unlicensed architecture school graduate participating in a defined internship program; develops design or technical solutions under supervision of an architect.  In the U.S., no state allows the use of the title \'\'architect\'\' by anyone who is not licensed to provide architectural services.\n|}\n\n==Fees==\n{{See also|Earnings for architects}}\nArchitects\' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project\'s allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project\'s size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%. But the average income for this occupation is about $35.14 per hour or $73,090 per year.\n\nOverall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner or shareholder, etc.) and the size and location of the firm.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n{{main|List of professional architecture organizations}}\nA number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture.\n\n==Prizes, awards, and titles==\n{{main|List of architecture prizes}}\nA wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] are awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures and professional careers.\n\nThe most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the \"[[Nobel Prize]] for [[architecture]].\" Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Royal Gold Medal]], the [[AIA Gold Medal]], and the [[Praemium Imperiale]].\n\nArchitects in the UK who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, might until 1971 be elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An Honorary Fellow may use the initials Hon. FRIBA. and an International Fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA.  Architects in the US who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and can write [[FAIA]] after their name. Architects in Canada who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made special contribution, after nomination and election by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), maybe elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name.\n\nArchitects in the [[Philippines]] and [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipino communities overseas]] (whether they are Filipinos or not), especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as \'\'Architect\'\', rather than \'\'Sir/Madam\'\' in speech or \'\'Mr./Mrs./Ms.\'\' (\'\'G./Gng./Bb.\'\' in Filipino) before surnames.

'Abbreviation'	'{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}\n: \'\'For the &lt;abbr&gt; HTML tag, see [[HTML element#abbr|HTML element &lt;abbr&gt;]]\'\'.\n[[File:Schriftprobe Latein 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Latin]] text with abbreviations]]\n\nAn \'\'\'abbreviation\'\'\' (from [[Latin]] \'\'brevis\'\', meaning \'\'short\'\') is a shortened form of a word or phrase.  It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word \'\'abbreviation\'\' can itself be represented by the abbreviation \'\'abbr.\'\', \'\'abbrv.\'\' or \'\'abbrev.\'\'\n\nIn strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], [[acronym]]s, or initialisms, with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all four are connoted by the term \"abbreviation\" in loose parlance.<ref name=harts>{{cite book|title=New Hart\'s Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uwGtj8i_vkC&dq=New+Hart%27s+Rules&q=acronyms+contractions+10.1#v=snippet&q=acronyms%20contractions%2010.1&f=false|isbn=0-19-861041-6}}</ref>{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or [[syllable]]s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the [[Council of Science Editors]]). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}\n\nAbbreviations have a long history, used so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the reduction of words to single letters was common.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HA9kAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA5&dq=abbreviations+history&hl=en&sa=X&ei=D2NaVIitA6vbsASp94DgAg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=abbreviations%20history&f=false \'\'The British Cyclopaedia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography\'\', Wm. S. Orr and Company, 1838, p.5.]</ref> In Roman inscriptions, \"Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation.\" However, \"some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, \'\'A\'\' can be an abbreviation for many words, such as \'\'ager\'\', \'\'amicus\'\', \'\'annus\'\', \'\'as\'\', \'\'Aulus\'\', \'\'Aurelius\'\', \'\'aurum\'\' and \'\'avus\'\'.)\"<ref>Adkins, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&dq=abbreviations++fashionable&q=abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v=snippet&q=abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22&f=false \'\'Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome\'\'], Infobase Publishing, 2004, p. 261.</ref>\n\nAbbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the [[old English]] poem [[Beowulf]] used many abbreviations, for example \'\'7\'\' or \'\'&\'\' for \'\'and\'\', and \'\'y\'\' for \'\'since\'\', so that \"not much space is wasted\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=68EjAwAAQBAJ&dq=abbreviations+history&q=abbreviations+beowulf#v=snippet&q=abbreviations%20beowulf&f=false Gelderen, E. v, , \'\'A History of the English Language: Revised edition\'\', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, Ch. 4 1.]</ref> The standardisation of [[English language|English]] in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.<ref>[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483?1660<!-- Bot generated title -->] Doesn\'t work.</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ?er? were replaced with {{unicode|???}}, as in {{unicode|?mast??}} for \'\'master\'\' and {{unicode|?exac?bate?}} for \'\'exacerbate\'\'. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n{{quote|{{unicode|Mast? subwarden? y ?m?de me to you. And wher? y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differr? thelection? ov? to qu?dena? tinitatis y have be thoug?t me syn? that itt woll be then? a bowte mydsom?.}}}}\n\nThe [[Early Modern English]] period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like \'\'y<sup>e</sup>\'\' for \'\'?<sup>e</sup>\'\', used for the word \'\'the\'\': \"hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe.\"<ref>Lass, R., \'\'The Cambridge History of the English Language\'\', Cambridge University Press, 2006, Vol. 2, p. 36.</ref>\n\nDuring the growth of [[philology|philological]] linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Likewise, a century earlier in [[Boston]], a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression \'Okeh\' and the Americanism \'Okay\' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does \"OK\" stand for? |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512085453/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the British greatly reduced the use of the [[full stop]] and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the \"[[Special Operations, Executive]]\"?\"S.O.,E\"?which is not found in histories written after about 1960.\n\nBut before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In [[French language|French]], the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is \'\'not\'\' the last letter of its antecedent:  \"M.\" is the abbreviation for \"monsieur\" while \"Mme\" is that for \"madame\". Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOver the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not [[personal computer]] (PC) or [[television]] (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.\n\nMinimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]] since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.\n\nWidespread use of electronic communication through [[Mobile phone#Mobile phones in society|mobile phones]] and [[Internet#Social impact|the Internet]] during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as [[Instant messaging|instant-]] and [[text messaging]]. [[Short Message Service|SMS]], for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.<ref>Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. ISBN 978-0-19-954490-5</ref> More recently [[Twitter]], a popular [[social networking service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.\n\n== Style conventions in English ==\n\nIn [[modern English]] there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be \'\'consistent\'\', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]]. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.\n\n=== Lowercase letters ===\n\nIf the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for \'\'Leviticus\'\'. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for \'\'year-to-date\'\', PCB for \'\'printed circuit board\'\' and FYI for \'\'for your information\'\'. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.\n\n=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===\n\nA period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.\n\nAccording to [[Hart\'s Rules]], the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.<ref name=\"harts\"/>{{rp|p167?170}} [[Fowler\'s Modern English Usage]] says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pocket Fowler\'s Modern English Usage|edition=2nd|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|isbn=9780191727078|contribution=Full stop}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Example\n!Category\n!Short form\n!Source\n|-\n|[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]\n|Contraction\n|Dr\n|D??r\n|-\n|[[Professor]]\n|Abbreviation\n|Prof.\n|Prof...\n|-\n|The [[Reverend]]\n|Abbreviation\n|Rev.\n|Rev...\n|-\n|The [[Reverend]]\n|Contraction\n|Revd\n|Rev??d\n|-\n|[[The Right Honourable]]\n|Contraction and Abbreviation\n|Rt Hon.\n|R??t Hon...\n|}\n\nIn [[American English]], the period is usually included. In some cases periods are optional, as in either \'\'US\'\' or \'\'U.S.\'\' for  \'\'United States\'\', \'\'EU\'\' or \'\'E.U.\'\' for \'\'European Union\'\', and \'\'UN\'\' or \'\'U.N.\'\' for \'\'United Nations\'\'. There are some house styles, however?American ones included?that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:\n* The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, \'\'\"Northwest Blvd\"\'\', \'\'\"W. Jefferson\"\'\', and \'\'\"PED XING\"\'\' all follow this recommendation.) \n* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]], used in many [[medical journal]]s, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus [[List of Latin phrases (E)#exempli gratia|eg]], [[List of Latin phrases (I)#id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[List of Latin phrases (E)#et alii|et al]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], [[Mr.|Mr]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[intensive care unit|ICU]], and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are \"[[Numero sign|No.]]\" (to avoid the appearance of \"[[yes and no|No]]\"); initials within persons\' names (such as \"George R. Smith\"); and \"St.\" within persons\' names when the person prefers it (such as \"Emily R. St. Clair\") (but not in city names such as \'\'St Louis\'\'  or \'\'St Paul\'\'). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from [[Latin]], [[New Latin]], other languages, or [[international scientific vocabulary|ISV]]; thus, no italic for [[List of Latin phrases (E)#exempli gratia|eg]], [[List of Latin phrases (I)#id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[List of Latin phrases (E)#et alii|et al]], [[in vivo]], [[in vitro]], or [[in situ]].)\n\nAcronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods.  Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[List of military slang terms#SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].\n\nToday, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters \"U.&nbsp;S.\"\n\nWhen an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.\n\n=== Plural forms ===\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an \'s\' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC\'s\". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,<ref name=\"Chicago\">Turabian, K., \'\'A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations\'\', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2</ref> allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.\'s\", while the [[Modern Language Association]]<ref name=\"MLA\">Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g</ref> explicitly says, \"do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation\".  Also, the [[American Psychological Association]] specifically says,<ref name=\"APA\">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29</ref> \"without an apostrophe\".\n\nHowever, the 1999 style guide for the [[New York Times]] states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring \"PC\'s, TV\'s and VCR\'s\".<ref>Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&id=RT5w0s7_op8C&dq=new+york+times+style&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=plurals+abbreviations \'\'The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage\'\'], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.</ref>\n\nFollowing those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of [[Runs Batted In]], simply add an s to the end of RBI.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner\'s Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}</ref>\n\n*RBIs\n\nFor all other rules, see below:\n\nTo form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase \'\'s\'\' to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.\n* A group of MPs\n* The roaring 20s\n* Mind your Ps and Qs\n\nTo indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.\n* 1&nbsp;lb or 20&nbsp;lb\n* 1&nbsp;ft or 16&nbsp;ft\n* 1 min or 45 min\n\nWhen an abbreviation contains more than one full point, \'\'Hart\'s Rules\'\' recommends putting the \'\'s\'\' after the final one.\n* Ph.D.s\n* M.Phil.s\n* the d.t.s\nHowever, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:\n* PhDs\n* MPhils\n* the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the \'\'New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors\'\'.)\n\nAccording to \'\'Hart\'s Rules\'\', an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.\n* The x\'s of the equation\n* Dot the i\'s and cross the t\'s\nHowever, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:\n* The \'\'x\'\'s of the equation\n* Dot the \'i\'s and cross the \'t\'s\n\nIn Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Singular abbreviation\n!Singular Word\n!Plural abbreviation\n!Plural Word\n!Discipline\n|-\n|d.\n| didot\n|dd.\n| didots\n| typography\n|-\n|f.\n| following line or page\n|ff.\n| following lines or pages\n|notes\n|-\n|F.\n| folio\n|Ff.\n| folios\n|literature\n|-\n|h.\n| hand\n|hh.\n| hands\n| horse height\n|-\n|l.\n| line\n|ll.\n| lines\n|notes\n|-\n|MS\n| manuscript\n|MSS\n| manuscripts\n|notes\n|-\n|op.\n| opus\n|opp.\n| opera\n|notes\n|-\n|p.\n|page\n|pp.\n| pages\n|notes\n|-\n|Q.\n| quarto\n|Qq.\n| quartos\n|literature\n|-\n|s.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] sets the style for abbreviations of units.\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n\nMany British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:\n* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and \'\'[[The Guardian]]\'\', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:\n** Social titles, like Ms or Mr (though these would usually not have had full stops?see above) Capt, Prof, \'\'etc.;\'\'\n** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (\'\'\"US\"\'\', not \'\'\"U.S.\"\'\');\n** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms{{clarify|date=November 2015}});\n** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (\'\'\"PR\"\'\', instead of \'\'\"p.r.\"\'\', or \'\'\"pr\"\'\')\n** Names (\'\'\"FW de Klerk\"\'\', \'\'\"GB Whiteley\"\'\', \'\'\"Park JS\"\'\').  A notable exception is \'\'[[The Economist]]\'\' which writes \'\'\"Mr F. W. de Klerk\"\'\'.\n** Scientific units (see Measurement below).\n* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as \'\'\"Nato\"\'\' or \'\'\"NATO\"\'\', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as \'\'\"Sars\"\'\' or \'\'\"SARS\"\'\' (compare with \'\'\"[[laser]]\"\'\' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).\n* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the \'\'\"British Broadcasting Corporation\"\'\' is abbreviated to \'\'\"BBC\"\'\', never \'\'\"Bbc\"\'\'. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.\n* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (<nowiki>100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10?C</nowiki>). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)\n\n==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====\n\n* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double \"l\" is a separate sound: \"Ll. George\" for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].\n* Some titles, such as \"Reverend\" and \"Honourable\", are spelt out when preceded by \"the\", rather than as \"Rev.\" or \"Hon.\" respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.\n* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.<ref>[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], \'\'The Elements of Technical Writing\'\', pg. 53. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. ISBN 0020130856</ref> Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.\n\n== Measurement shorthand?symbol or abbreviation ==\n[[Image:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|200px|Road sign in China?\"km\" is a symbol, not an abbreviation, as it is not a contraction of a Chinese word]]\n\nWriters often use shorthand to denote units of measure.  Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as \"in\" for \"[[inch]]\" or can be a symbol such as \"km\" for \"[[kilometre]]\".\n\nThe shorthand \"in\" applies to English only?in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for example, the shorthand \"dm\" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word \"duim\".<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Woordeboek/Dictionary; Afrikaans-English / Engels-Afrikaans\n| editor = Abel Coetzee\n| publisher = Collins\n| year = 1969\n| oclc = 29232187\n| location = Glasgow and Johannesburg}}</ref> Since both \"in\" and \"dm\" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as \"Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title = Oxford Concise Dictionary\n|publisher = Oxford University Press\n|year = 1964}}</ref> applies the appropriate shorthand by \'\'substitution\'\' rather than by \'\'contraction\'\'. Since the shorthand for kilometre (\'\'[[:pt:Quil?metro|quil?metro]]\'\' in Portuguese or \'\'[[:el:??????????|??????????]]\'\' in Greek) is \"km\" in both languages and the letter \"k\" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, \"km\" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a [[logogram]] rather than an abbreviation.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI) manual<ref>{{SIbrochure8th}}</ref> the word \"symbol\" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also [[International System of Units|defines the way in which units should be written]], the principal rules being:\n*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed?for example 1&nbsp;MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000&nbsp;mW (milliwatts).\n*No periods should be inserted between letters?for example \"m.s\" (which is an approximation of \"m?s\", which correctly uses [[middle dot]]) is the symbol for \"metres multiplied by seconds\", but \"ms\" is the symbol for milliseconds.\n*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).\n*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical?not all languages use the letter \"s\" to denote a plural.\n\n== Syllabic abbreviation ==\n\nA \'\'\'syllabic abbreviation\'\'\' is an abbreviation formed from (usually) initial syllables of several words, such as \'\'[[Interpol]]\'\' = \'\'\'\'\'Inter\'\'\'national\'\' + \'\'\'\'\'pol\'\'\'ice\'\'. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.\n\n=== Usage ===\n\n==== Different languages ====\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English or French. The [[United States Navy]], however, often uses syllabic abbreviations, as described below, and some [[UK]] government ministries such as [[Ofcom]] (\'\'\'\'\'Of\'\'\'fice  of \'\'\'Com\'\'\'munications\'\') and [[Oftel]] (\'\'\'\'\'Of\'\'\'fice of \'\'\'Tel\'\'\'ecommunications\'\') does use this style.\n\nOn the other hand, they prevailed in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, \'\'[[Gestapo]]\'\' stands for \'\'\'\'\'Ge\'\'\'heime \'\'\'Sta\'\'\'ats-\'\'\'Po\'\'\'lizei\'\', or \"secret state police\". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the \'\'[[Comintern]]\'\' (\'\'Communist International\'\') and \'\'[[Komsomol]]\'\' (\'\'\'\'\'Kom\'\'\'munisticheskii \'\'\'So\'\'\'yuz \'\'\'Mol\'\'\'odyozhi\'\', or \"Communist youth union\") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has caused syllabic abbreviations to have negative connotations{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (as in Orwell\'s [[Newspeak]]), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., \'\'[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]\'\' for \'\'Schutzpolizei\'\'.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. \'\'[[Stasi]]\'\' for \'\'Staatssicherheit\'\' (\"state security\", the secret police) or \'\'Vopo\'\' for \'\'Volkspolizist\'\' (\"people\'s policeman\"). Other uses are in company or product names such as [[Aldi]], [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]], [[Hanuta]] or [[Haribo]].\n\nEast Asian languages whose writing systems use [[Chinese characters]] form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.  For example, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the term for the [[United Nations]], \'\'kokusai reng?\'\' (????) is often abbreviated to \'\'kokuren\'\' (??). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:??|ryakugo]] (??) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; see also [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, \'\'B?id?\'\' (??) for \'\'B?ij?ng D?xu?\'\' (????, [[Peking University]]) and \'\'T?dai\'\' (??) for \'\'T?ky? daigaku\'\' (????, [[University of Tokyo]]).  The English phrase \"[[:wikt:gung ho|Gung ho]]\" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.\n\n==== Organizations ====\n{{See also|Neologism}}\n\nPartially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence \'\'[[DESRON]] 6\'\' is used (in the full capital form) to mean \"Destroyer Squadron 6\", while \'\'[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]\'\' would be \"Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic.\"\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Clipping (morphology)]]\n* [[List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions]]\n* [[List of abbreviations in photography]]\n* [[List of acronyms]]\n* [[List of classical abbreviations]]\n* [[List of medieval abbreviations]]\n* [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary:Abbreviations in Webster|The abbreviations used in the 1913 edition of Webster\'s dictionary]]\n* [[Abbreviation (music)]]\n* [[Numeronym]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Abbreviation}}\n\n*{{dmoz|/Reference/Dictionaries/Acronyms/|Acronyms}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Abbreviations| ]]'

Her [[interpretatio romana|Roman equivalent]] is the goddess {{lang|la|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]}}.<ref name=Lar>\'\'Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia\'\', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref> She is identified with the planet [[Venus]].\n\nAs with many ancient Greek deities, there is more than one story about her origins. According to [[Hesiod]]\'s \'\'[[Theogony]]\'\', she was born when [[Cronus]] cut off [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]\'s genitals and threw them into the sea, and she arose from the sea foam (\'\'aphros\'\'). <!-- Thus Aphrodite is of a generation older than [[Zeus]]. -->\nAccording to [[Homer]]\'s \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\', she is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]]. According to [[Plato]] (\'\'Symposium\'\', 180e), these two origins were of entirely separate entities: [[Aphrodite Urania|Aphrodite Ourania]] and [[Aphrodite Pandemos]].\n\nBecause of her beauty, other gods feared that their rivalry over her would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war, so [[Zeus]] married her to [[Hephaestus]], who, because of his ugliness and deformity, was not seen as a threat. Aphrodite had many lovers?both gods, such as [[Ares]], and men, such as [[Anchises]]. She played a role in the [[Eros and Psyche]] legend, and later was both [[Adonis]]\'s lover and his surrogate mother. Many lesser beings were said to be children of Aphrodite.\n\nAphrodite is also known as \'\'\'Cytherea\'\'\' (\'\'Lady of Cythera\'\') and \'\'\'Cypris\'\'\' (\'\'Lady of Cyprus\'\') after the two cult sites, [[Kythira|Cythera]] and [[Cyprus]], which claimed to be her place of birth.  [[Myrtle (plant)|Myrtle]], [[dove]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[swan]]s were said to be sacred to her. The ancient Greeks identified her with the Ancient Egyptian goddess [[Hathor]].<ref>Reginald Eldred Witt, \'\'Isis in the ancient world\'\' (Johns Hopkins University Press) 1997:125.\nISBN 0-8018-5642-6</ref>\n\nAphrodite had many other names, such as Acidalia, Cytherea, and Cerigo, each used by a different local cult of the goddess in Greece. The Greeks recognized all of these names as referring to the single goddess Aphrodite, despite the slight differences in what these local cults believed the goddess demanded of them. The Attic philosophers of the 4th century, however, drew a distinction between a celestial Aphrodite (Aphrodite Urania) of transcendent principles, and a separate, \"common\" Aphrodite who was the goddess of the people (Aphrodite Pandemos).\n\n==Etymology==\n\'\'Aphrodite\'\', perhaps altered after \'\'aphr?s\'\' ({{lang|el|?????}}) \"foam\", stems from the more archaic [[Cretan]] \'\'Aphord?ta\'\' and Cypriot \'\'Aphorod?ta\'\', and was probably ultimately borrowed from Cypriot [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].<ref>[[Robert Beekes]], \'\'Etymological Dictionary of Greek\'\', Vol. 1 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), 179.</ref> [[Herodotus]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] recorded that Aphrodite\'s oldest non-Greek temple lay in the Syrian city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] where she was known as \'\'Ourania\'\', an obvious reference to [[Astarte]]. This suggests that Aphrodite\'s cult located at [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]]-[[Cyprus]] came from the Phoenicians. The fact that one of Aphrodite\'s chief centers of worship remained on the southwestern Cypriot coast settled by Phoenicians, where the goddess had long been worshiped as \'\'[[Astarte|Ashtart]]\'\' (??trt), points to the transmission of Aphrodite\'s original cult from Phoenicia to Cyprus then to mainland Greece.<ref>Pausanias 1.14.6-7, W.S. Jones (trans.), Pausianas: Descriptions of Greece (London, 1931).</ref> So far, however, attempts to derive the name from Aphrodite\'s Semitic precursor have been inconclusive.\n\nA number of [[false etymology|false etymologies]] have been proposed through the ages. [[Hesiod]] derives \'\'Aphrodite\'\' from \'\'aphr?s\'\' \"foam,\" interpreting the name as \"risen from the foam\".<ref>Hesiod, \'\'[[Theogony]]\'\', 176ff.</ref><ref>Kretschmer \'\'KZ\'\' 33 (1895): 267.</ref> Janda (2010), accepting this as genuine, claims the foam birth myth as an [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] mytheme. Janda intereprets the name as a compound \'\'aphr?s\'\' \"foam\" and \'\'d?ato\'\'<!--d?ato [sic]--> \"[she] seems, shines\", meaning \"she who shines from the foam [ocean]\", supposedly a byname of [[Eos]], the [[Hausos|dawn goddess]].<ref name=\"Janda\">Janda, Michael, \'\'Die Musik nach dem Chaos\'\', Innsbruck 2010, p. 65</ref> Likewise, Mallory and Adams (1997)<ref>Mallory, J.P., and Adams, D.Q. \'\'[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]\'\'. London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1997.</ref> propose an Indo-European compound \'\'{{PIE|*ab?or-}}\'\' \"very\" and \'\'{{PIE|*d?ei-}}\'\' \"to shine\", also referring to Eos. However, etymologies based on comparison with Eos are unlikely since Aphrodite\'s attributes are entirely different from those of Eos (or the [[Vedic deity]] [[Ushas]]).<ref>Charles Penglase, \'\'Greek Myths and Mesopotamia: Parallels and Influence in the Homeric Hymns and Hesiod\'\' (Routledge, 1997), 164; citing Deborah Boedeker, \'\'Aphrodite\'s Entry into Greek Epic\'\' (Leiden: Brill, 1974), 15-6.</ref> Finally, the medieval \'\'[[Etymologicum Magnum]]\'\' offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving \'\'Aphrodite\'\' from the compound \'\'habrod?aitos\'\' ({{lang|grc|???????????}}), \"she who lives delicately\", from \'\'habr?s\'\' and \'\'d?aita\'\'. The alteration from \'\'b\'\' to \'\'ph\'\' is explained as a \"familiar\" characteristic of Greek \"obvious from the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Macedonians]]\",<ref>Etymologicum Magnum, ????????</ref> despite the fact that the name cannot be of Macedonian origin.\n\nA number of improbable non-Greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship. One Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian \'\'bar?r?tu\'\', the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts.<ref>see Chicago Assyrian Dictionary vol. 2 p.&nbsp;111</ref> Hammarstr?m (1921)<ref>M. Hammarstr?m, \'\'Glotta: Zeitschrift f?r griechische und lateinische Sprache\'\' 11 (1921): 215f.</ref> looks to [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], comparing \'\'(e)pr?ni\'\' \"lord\", an Etruscan honorific loaned into Greek as [[Prytaneis|????????]]. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, \"the lady\". [[Hjalmar Frisk]] and Robert Beekes (2010) rejects this etymology as implausible, especially since Aphrodite actually appears in Etruscan in the borrowed form \'\'Apru\'\' (from Greek \'\'Aphr?\'\', clipped form of \'\'Aphrodite\'\').\n\n==Mythology==\n\n=== Birth ===\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|410px|\'\'[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]\'\' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], \'\'circa\'\' 1485.]]\nAphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship,  [[Paphos]], on the island of [[Cyprus]], which is why she is sometimes called \"Cyprian\", especially in the poetic works of [[Sappho]]. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], hence another of her names, \"Cytherea\".<ref>Homer, \'\'Odyssey\'\' viii. 288; Herodotus i. 105; Pausanias iii. 23. ? 1; Anacreon v. 9; Horace, \'\'Carmina\'\' i. 4. 5.</ref> Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between [[Crete]] and the [[Peloponnese|Peloponesus]], so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite\'s cult from the [[Levant|Middle East]] to mainland [[Greece]].\n\nIn the most famous version of her myth, her birth was the consequence of a castration: [[Cronus]] severed [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus\']] genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, meaning \"foam-arisen\"), while the [[Erinyes]] (furies), and the [[Meliae]] emerged from the drops of his blood.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths | publisher=Penguin Books | author=Graves, Robert | year=1960 | location=London | pages=37 | isbn=9780140171990}}</ref> [[Hesiod\'s Theogony|Hesiod]] states that the genitals \"were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew.\" The girl, Aphrodite, floated ashore on a [[scallop]] shell. This iconic representation of Aphrodite as a mature \"Venus rising from the sea\" (\'\'[[Venus Anadyomene]]\'\'<ref>\'\'??????????\'\' (\'\'Anady?men?\'\'), \"rising up\".</ref>) was made famous in a much-admired painting by [[Apelles]], now lost, but described in the \'\'[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]\'\' of [[Pliny the Elder]].\n\n[[File:Aphrodites Rock.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Petra tou Romiou]] (\"The rock of the [[Greeks|Greek]]\"), Aphrodite\'s legendary birthplace in [[Paphos]], Cyprus.]]\n\nIn another version of her origin,<ref>\'\'[[Iliad]]\'\' (Book&nbsp;V)</ref> she was considered a daughter of Zeus and [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]], the mother goddess whose oracle was at [[Dodona]]. Aphrodite herself was sometimes also referred to as \"Dione\". \"Dione\" seems to be a feminine form of \"Dios\", \"of Zeus\", the [[genitive]] form case of [[Zeus]], and could be taken to mean simply \"(she) that belongs to Zeus\" in a generic sense. Aphrodite might, then, be an equivalent of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the [[Earth Mother]], whom Homer relocated to Olympus.\n\n===Adulthood===\nAphrodite is consistently portrayed, in every image and story, as having had no childhood, and instead being born as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult. She is often depicted nude. In many of the later myths, she is portrayed as vain, ill-tempered, and easily offended. Although she is married?she is one of the few gods in the [[List of Greek mythological characters|Greek Pantheon]] who is?she is frequently unfaithful to her husband.\n\nAccording to one version of Aphrodite\'s story, because of her immense beauty Zeus fears that the other gods will become violent with each other in their rivalry to possess her. To forestall this, he forces her to marry [[Hephaestus]], the dour, humorless god of smithing. In another version of the story, his mother, [[Hera]] casts him off Olympus, deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit the home of the gods. His revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne. In return for her release, he demands to be given Aphrodite\'s hand in marriage.\n\nHephaestus is overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forges her beautiful jewelry, including the \'\'cestus\'\', a girdle that makes her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage causes Aphrodite to seek other male companionship, most often Ares, but also sometimes [[Adonis]].\n\nAphrodite\'s husband [[Hephaestus]] is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities, but in the \'\'[[Odyssey]]\'\', she is portrayed as preferring [[Ares]], the volatile god of war, because she is attracted to his violent nature.\n\nAphrodite is a major figure in the [[Trojan War]] legend. She is a contestant in the \"Judgement of Paris\" (see below), which leads to the war. She had been the lover of the Trojan [[Anchises]], and mother of his son [[Aeneas]]. Later, during the war, she saves Aeneas from [[Diomedes]], who wounds her.\n\n===Adonis===\n{{Main|Adonis}}\n[[File:Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) (Italian - Venus and Adonis - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|370px|\'\'Venus and Adonis\'\' by [[Titian]], \'\'circa\'\' 1554.]]\n\nThe most prominent lover of Aphrodite is [[Adonis]]. He is the child of  [[Myrrha]], cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King [[Cinyras]] of [[Cyprus]], after Myrrha\'s mother bragged that her daughter is more beautiful than the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha is changed into a [[myrrh]] tree, but still gives birth to Adonis.\n\nAphrodite finds the baby, and takes him to the underworld to be fostered by [[Persephone]]. She returns for him when he is grown and strikingly handsome, but Persephone wants to keep him. Zeus decrees that Adonis will spend a third of the year with Aphrodite, a third with Persephone, and a third with whomever he wishes. Adonis chooses Aphrodite, and they are constantly together.\n\nAdonis, who loves hunting, is slain by a wild boar. He bleeds to death, and Aphrodite can only mourn over his body. She causes [[anemone]]s to grow wherever his blood fell, and decrees a festival on the anniversary of his death.\n\nThe shade of Adonis is received in the underworld by Persephone. Aphrodite wants to return him to life. Again, she and Persephone bicker. Zeus intervenes again, decreeing that Adonis will spend six months with Aphrodite and six months with Persephone.\n\n===The Judgement of Paris===\n{{Main|Judgement of Paris}}\n\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|right||This painting shows [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] surveying Aphrodite naked, with the other two goddesses watching nearby.

(\'\'[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|El Juicio de Paris]]\'\' by [[Enrique Simonet]], \'\'circa\'\' 1904)]]\n\nThe gods are all invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]), except [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord. In revenge, Eris makes a golden [[Apple of Discord]] inscribed \'\'kallist?i\'\' (\"to the fairest one\"), which she throws among the goddesses. Aphrodite, [[Hera]], and [[Athena]] all claim it.\n\n[[Zeus]] delegates the choice to a mortal, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. The goddesses offer him bribes. Hera offers him supreme power, and Athena offers him wisdom, fame, and glory in battle. Aphrodite offers him [[Helen of Troy]], the most beautiful mortal woman in the world, as a wife. As the goddess of desire, she causes Paris to become inflamed with desire for Helen at first sight,  and he awards the Apple to her. Helen is already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]]. The other two goddesses are enraged by this, and through Helen\'s abduction by Paris, they bring about the [[Trojan War]].\n\n===Consorts and children===\n# [[Hephaestus]]\n# [[Ares]]\n## [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]]\n## [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]]\n## [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]]\n## [[Adrestia]] (or [[Adrasteia]] (nymph) or [[Adrasteia (goddess)]])\n## [[Erotes (mythology)|The Erotes]]\n### [[Eros]]<ref name=\"eros\"/>\n### [[Anteros]]\n### [[Himeros]]\n### [[Pothos (mythology)|Pothos]]\n# [[Poseidon]]\n## [[Rhode (mythology)|Rhode]] (possibly)\n# [[Hermes]]\n## [[Tyche]] (possibly)\n## [[Hermaphroditos]]\n# [[Dionysus]]\n## The [[Charites]] (Graces)\n### [[Thalia (Grace)|Thalia]]\n### [[Euphrosyne (mythology)|Euphrosyne]]\n### [[Aglaea]]\n## [[Priapus]] ([[Nota bene|N.B.]] Some say that Adonis, not Dionysus was the father of Priapus)<ref name=Graves70>{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths | publisher=Penguin Books | author=Graves, Robert | year=1960 | location=London | pages=70 | isbn=9780140171990}}</ref>\n# Zeus \n## Tyche (possibly)\n#[[Adonis]]\n##[[Beroe (mythology)|Beroe]]\n##[[Golgos]]<ref name=Graves70 />\n# [[Phaethon (son of Eos)]]\n## Astynoos\n# [[Anchises]]\n## [[Aeneas]]\n## Lyrus\n# [[Butes]]\n## [[Eryx]]\n#unknown father\n## Meligounis + several more unnamed daughters<ref>[[Hesychius of Alexandria]] s. v. ??????????: \"Meligounis: this is what the island [[Lipara]] was called.

[[Plato]], \'\'[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]\'\' 181a-d.</ref> Among the [[neo-Platonist]]s and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Aphrodite Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love. (We know of this representation, said to have been a [[chryselephantine]] sculpture made by [[Phidias]] for [[Elis]], only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]).<ref>Pausanias, \'\'Periegesis\'\' vi.25.1; \'\'Aphrodite Pandemos\'\' was represented in the same temple riding on a goat, symbol of purely carnal rut: \"The meaning of the tortoise and of the he-goat I leave to those who care to guess,\" Pausanias remarks. The image was taken up again after the Renaissance: see [http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc195 Andrea Alciato, \'\'Emblemata / Les emblemes\'\' (1584)].</ref>\n\nIn the \'\'[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]\'\',<ref>Plato, \'\'[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]\'\' 180e.</ref> of [[Plato]], [[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias]] (no relation to the geographer Pausanias) describes Aphrodite. He distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories of her creation. The older one, \'\'Aphrodite Ourania\'\' (\"heavenly\" Aphrodite), is the daughter of Uranus, and inspires homosexual male (and more specifically, [[Ephebic Oath|ephebic]]) love/eros. The younger, \'\'Aphrodite Pandemos\'\' (\"Common\" Aphrodite) is the daughter of Zeus and Dione, and all love for women comes from her.<ref>Richard L.

This is especially true in Sparta.\n\n==Cult of Aphrodite==\nThe epithet \'\'Aphrodite Acidalia\'\' was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used for bathing, located in [[Boeotia]] ([[Virgil]] I, 720).  She was also called \'\'Kypris\'\' or \'\'Cytherea\'\' after her birth-places in [[Cyprus]] and [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], respectively, both centers of her cult. She was associated with [[Hesperides|Hesperia]] and frequently accompanied by the [[Oread]]s, [[nymph]]s of the mountains.\n\nHer festival, \'\'[[Aphrodisia]]\'\', was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in [[Athens]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]. At the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of [[Acrocorinth]] (before the Roman destruction of the city in 146 BC), intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshiping Aphrodite. This temple was not rebuilt when the city was re-established under Roman rule in 44 BC, but the fertility rituals likely continued in the main city near the agora.\n\nAphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with, the sea, dolphins, doves, swans, [[pomegranate]]s, sceptres, apples, [[Myrtus|myrtle]], rose trees, [[lime (fruit)|lime]] trees, clams, scallop shells, and pearls.\n\nOne aspect of the [[cult (religion)|cult]] of Aphrodite and her precedents that [[Thomas Bulfinch]]\'s much-reprinted \'\'The Age of Fable; or Stories of Gods and Heroes\'\' (1855 etc.) elided<ref>\"Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.\" Bulfinch\'s obituary in the \'\'Boston Evening Standard\'\' noted that the contents were \"expurgated of all that would be offensive\".</ref> was the practice of [[Religious prostitution|ritual prostitution]] in her shrines and temples. The euphemism in Greek is \'\'hierodoule\'\', \"sacred slave.\" The practice was an inherent part of the rituals owed to Aphrodite\'s Near Eastern forebears, Sumerian [[Inanna]] and Akkadian [[Ishtar]], whose temple priestesses were the \"women of Ishtar,\" \'\'ishtaritum\'\'.<ref>Miroslav Marcovich, \"From Ishtar to Aphrodite\" \'\'Journal of Aesthetic Education\'\' \'\'\'30\'\'\'.2, Special Issue: Distinguished Humanities Lectures II (Summer 1996) p 49.</ref>\n\nThe practice has been documented in Babylon, Syria, and Palestine, in Phoenician cities and the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] colony [[Carthage]], and for Hellenic Aphrodite in [[Cyprus]], the center of her cult, Cythera, [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and in Sicily (Marcovich 1996:49); the practice however is not attested in Athens. Aphrodite was everywhere the patroness of the \'\'[[hetaera]]\'\' and [[courtesan]]. In [[Ionia]] on the coast of Asia Minor, \'\'[[Hierodule|hierodoulai]]\'\' served in the [[temple of Artemis]].\n\n===Modern worship of Aphrodite===\nAs one of the Twelve Olympians of the Greek pantheon and thus a major deity, worship of Aphrodite, (or \'\'Aphrod?ti\'\'), as a living goddess is one of the more prominent devotionals in \'\'[[Hellenismos]]\'\' (Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism),<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22972610 BBC News - The Greeks who worship the ancient gods<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the revival of ancient Greek religious practices in the present day.<ref>[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/pagantraditions/p/Hellenism.htm Hellenic Polytheism: Following the Ways of the Ancient Greeks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHellenic polytheists of today celebrate their religious devotion to Aphrodite on two annual and monthly festival days.  Aphrodisia is her main festival day, which is celebrated on the 4th day of \'\'Hekatombaion\'\' in the [[Attic calendar]], falling in the months of July and August in the [[Gregorian calendar]], depending on the year. Adonia, a joint festival of Aphrodite and her partner Adonis, is celebrated on the first [[full moon]] following the [[Northern spring equinox]], often roughly as the same week the Christian festival of [[Easter]] is celebrated. The fourth day of each month is considered a sacred day of both Aphrodite and her son Eros.<ref name=\"neokoroi.org\">[http://www.neokoroi.org/religion/gods/aphrodite Aphrodite<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDevotional offerings to Aphrodite can include incense, fruit (particularly apples and pomegranates), flowers (particularly fragrant roses), sweet dessert wine (particularly \'\'Commandaria\'\' wine from [[Cyprus]]), and cakes made with honey.<ref>[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/godsandgoddesses/a/Offerings_Gods.htm Offerings to the Gods<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://sacredhaven.ca/aphrodite Aphrodite | Sacred Haven Coven<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Comparative mythology==\n\n===Ancient Near Eastern parallels===\nThe [[religions of the ancient Near East]] have a number of love goddesses that may be similar to certain aspects of Aphrodite.\n\nHer cult in Greece was imported from, or influenced by, the cult of [[Astarte]] in [[Phoenicia]].\n\nHans Georg Wunderlich further connects Aphrodite with the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Snake Goddess|snake goddess]].<ref>Wunderlich (R. Winston, tr.).\'\'The secret of Crete\'\' (1987:134)</ref>\n\nThe Egyptian snake goddess [[Wadjet]] was associated with the city known to the Greeks as \'\'Aphroditopolis\'\' (the city of Aphrodite).<ref>C.L.

The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]].<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.14.7 I. XIV.7]</ref>\n\nAn origin of (or significant influence on) the Greek love goddess from Near Eastern traditions was seen with some skepticism in classical 19th century scholarship. Authors such as A. Enmann (\'\'Kypros und der Ursprung des Aphroditekultes\'\' 1881) attempted to portray the cult of Aphrodite as a native Greek development.\n\nScholarly opinion on this question has shifted significantly since the 1980s, notably due to [[Walter Burkert]] (1984), and the significant influence of the Near East on early Greek religion in general (and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular) is now widely recognized as dating to a period of [[Orientalizing period|orientalization]] during the 8th century BC, when [[archaic Greece]] was on the fringes of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].<ref>see Burkert in his introduction to \'\'The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age\'\' (1992), especially in pp 1-6.</ref>\n\nIn native Greek tradition, the planet Venus had two names, \'\'Hesperos\'\' as the evening star and \'\'Eosphoros\'\' as the morning star. The Greeks adopted the identification of the morning and the evening stars, as well as its identification as Ishtar/Aphrodite, during the 4th century BC, along with other items of Babylonian astrology, such as the [[zodiac]] ([[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]).\n\n===Comparison with the Indo-European dawn goddess===\nIt has long been accepted in [[comparative mythology]] that Aphrodite (regardless of possible oriental influences) preserves some aspects of the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] dawn goddess [[Hausos|*Hausos]] (properly Greek [[Eos]], Latin  [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], Sanskrit [[Ushas]]).<ref>Dum?zil, \'\'Ouranos-V?runa:?tude de mythologie comp?ree indo-europ?ene\'\'. Paris: Maisonneuve. 1934</ref>\n\nJanda (2010) etymologizes her name as \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod\'s \'\'Theogony\'\' account of Aphrodite\'s birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth.  Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme  would then be directly cognate to the [[Rig Veda|Rigvedic]] myth of [[Indra]] defeating [[Vrtra]], liberating [[Ushas]].<ref name=\"Janda\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:CallipygianVenus.jpg|\'\'The [[Venus Kallipygos]].\'\' \'\'Aphrodite Kallipygos\'\' (\"Aphrodite of the Beautiful Buttocks\"),<ref>The word callipygian is defined as \"having shapely buttocks\" by [[Merriam-Webster]].</ref> is a type of nude female statue of the [[Hellenistic]] era.

And what antisymmetry means here is that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if \'\'n\'\' and \'\'m\'\' are distinct and \'\'n\'\' is a factor of \'\'m\'\', then \'\'m\'\' cannot be a factor of \'\'n\'\'.\n\nIn [[mathematical notation]], this is:\n\n:<math>\\forall a, b \\in X,\\ R(a,b) \\and R(b,a) \\; \\Rightarrow \\; a = b</math>\n\nor, equivalently,\n\n<!-- this is the same formula as above, but due to the addition of the negation, it is more clear where the term anti-symmetric comes from -->\n:<math>\\forall a, b \\in X,\\ R(a,b) \\and a \\ne b \\Rightarrow \\lnot  R(b,a) .</math>\n\nThe usual [[order relation]] ? on the [[real number]]s is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers \'\'x\'\' and \'\'y\'\' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] \'\'x\'\'&nbsp;?&nbsp;\'\'y\'\' and \'\'y\'\'&nbsp;?&nbsp;\'\'x\'\' hold then \'\'x\'\' and \'\'y\'\' must be equal. Similarly,  the [[subset order]] ? on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\', if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in \'\'A\'\' also is in \'\'B\'\' and every element in \'\'B\'\' is also in \'\'A\'\', then \'\'A\'\' and \'\'B\'\' must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:\n:<math>A \\subseteq B \\and B \\subseteq A \\Rightarrow A = B</math>\n\n[[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are antisymmetric by definition. A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and antisymmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the \"preys on\" relation on biological [[species]]).\n\nAntisymmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]], which requires both antisymmetry and [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe relation \"\'\'x\'\' is even, \'\'y\'\' is odd\" between a pair (\'\'x\'\', \'\'y\'\') of [[integer]]s is antisymmetric:\n::[[File:Even and odd antisymmetric relation.png|Even and odd antisymmetric relation]]\n\nEvery [[asymmetric relation]] is also an antisymmetric relation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Symmetric relation]]\n* [[Asymmetric relation]]\n* [[Symmetry in mathematics]]\n\n==References==\n*{{MathWorld | urlname=AntisymmetricRelation | title=Antisymmetric Relation}}\n*{{cite book |title=Theory and Problems of Discrete Mathematics |first=Seymour |last=Lipschutz |authorlink=Seymour Lipschutz |author2=Marc Lars Lipson |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-038045-7 |page=33}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Antisymmetric Relation}}\n[[Category:Mathematical relations]]'

He founded the religion and philosophy of [[Thelema]], identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the [[Aeon (Thelema)|?on of Horus]] in the early 20th century.\n\nBorn to a wealthy [[Plymouth Brethren]] family in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], Crowley rejected this [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] faith to pursue an interest in [[Western esotericism]]. He was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a [[List of intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom|British intelligence agency]], further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where he was trained in ceremonial magic by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]]. Moving to [[Boleskine House]] by [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], before studying [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices in India. He married [[Rose Edith Kelly]] and in 1904 they honeymooned in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named [[Aiwass]], who provided him with \'\'[[The Book of the Law]]\'\', a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the ?on of Horus, \'\'The Book\'\' declared that its followers should adhere to the code of \"Do what thou wilt\" and seek to align themselves with their Will through the practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]].\n\nAfter [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga]] and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and [[George Cecil Jones]] co-founded a Thelemite order, the [[A?A?]], through which they propagated the religion. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the [[First World War]] in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the [[Abbey of Thelema]], a religious commune in [[Cefal?]], Sicily where he lived with various followers. His [[libertine]] lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.\n\nCrowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a [[recreational drug use|recreational drug experimenter]], [[bisexual]] and an [[Individualism|individualist]] [[social criticism|social critic]]. He was denounced in the popular press as \"the wickedest man in the world\", and labelled a [[Satanism|Satanist]] because of his embrace of the title \'The Beast\'. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter-culture, and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. In 2002, a [[BBC]] poll ranked him as the seventy-third [[100 Greatest Britons|greatest Briton of all time]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Youth: 1875?94===\nCrowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=4?5|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=15|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=14}} His father, Edward Crowley (1834?87), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley\'s Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=2?3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=31?23|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=4?8|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=14?15}} His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848?1917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as \"the Beast\", a name that he revelled in.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=18?21|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=13?16|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=17?21}} The couple had been married at London\'s Kensington Registry Office in November 1874,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=13?14|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=17}} and were evangelical Christians. Crowley\'s father had been born a [[Quaker]], but had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a faction of a [[Christian fundamentalist]] group known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley\'s father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=3?4, 6, 9?10|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=17?23|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=11?12, 16}} Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=6?7|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=16|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=24}} At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon\'s evangelical Christian boarding school in [[Hastings]], and then to Ebor preparatory school in [[Cambridge]], run by the Reverend Henry d\'Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=12?14|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=25?29|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=17?18|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=24}}\n\nIn March 1887, when Crowley was 11, his father died of [[oral cancer|tongue cancer]]. Crowley described this as a turning point in his life,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=15|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=24?25|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=19|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=24?25}} and he always maintained an admiration of his father, describing him as \"his hero and his friend\".{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=10|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=21}} Inheriting a third of his father\'s wealth, he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowley\'s family removed him from the school when he developed [[albuminuria]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1pp=27?30|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2pp=19, 21?22}} He then attended [[Malvern College]] and [[Tonbridge School]], both of which he despised and left after a few terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=32?39|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=32?33|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=27|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=26?27}} He became increasingly sceptical regarding Christianity, pointing out [[inconsistencies in the Bible]] to his religious teachers,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=15?16|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=25?26|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=23}} and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking, masturbating, and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted [[gonorrhea]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=26?27|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=33|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=24,27|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=26}} Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in [[Eastbourne]], he undertook chemistry courses at [[Eastbourne College]]. Crowley developed interests in [[chess]], poetry, and [[mountain climbing]], and in 1894 climbed [[Beachy Head]] before visiting the [[Alps]] and joining the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]. The following year he returned to the [[Bernese Alps]], climbing the [[Eiger]], [[Trift Glacier|Trift]], [[Jungfrau]], [[M?nch]], and [[Wetterhorn]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=39?43|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=30?32, 34|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=27?30|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=26?27}}\n\n===Cambridge University: 1895?98===\n\nHaving adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was entered for the [[Moral Science]] [[Tripos]] studying philosophy. With approval from his personal tutor, he changed to English literature, which was not then part of the curriculum offered.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=49|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=34?35|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=32|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=27?28}} Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes, becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=51?52|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=36?37|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=23}} Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry, particularly the works of [[Richard Francis Burton]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kaczynski|1y=2010|1p=35}} Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as \'\'[[Granta|The Granta]]\'\', \'\'Cambridge Magazine\'\', and \'\'Cantab\'\'.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=50?51|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=33?35}} He continued his mountaineering, going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898, often with his friend [[Oscar Eckenstein]], and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the [[M?nch]] without a guide. These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.{{sfnm|1a1=Symonds|1y=1997|1p=13|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2pp=53?56|3a1=Sutin|3y=2000|3pp=50?52|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=35, 42?45, 50?51|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5p=35}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=For many years I had loathed being called Alick, partly because of the unpleasant sound and sight of the word, partly because it was the name by which my mother called me.

I had read in some book or other that the most favourable name for becoming famous was one consisting of a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] followed by a [[spondee]], as at the end of a [[hexameter]]: like \'\'Jeremy Taylor\'\'. Aleister Crowley fulfilled these conditions and Aleister is the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] form of Alexander.

They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley\'s increasing interest in Western esotericism, a breakup that Crowley would regret for many years.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=64?65|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=41?47|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=37?40, 45|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=33?24}}\n\nIn 1897, Crowley travelled to [[St Petersburg]] in Russia, later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2006|1pp=19?20|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=37|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=35|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=30?31}} Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2006|1pp=19?20|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2pp=30?31}}\n\nIn October 1897, a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and \"the futility of all human endeavour\", and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=57?58|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=37?39|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=36}} In March 1898, he obtained [[A.E. Waite]]\'s \'\'The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts\'\' (1898), and then [[Karl von Eckartshausen]]\'s \'\'The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary\'\' (1896), furthering his occult interests.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=58?59|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=41|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=40?42}}\nIn 1898 Crowley privately published 100 copies of his poem \'\'Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In\'\', but it was not a particular success.{{Sfnm|1a1=Symonds|1y=1997|1pp=14?15|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2pp=72?73|3a1=Sutin|3y=2000|3pp=44?45|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=46?47}} That same year he published a string of other poems, including \'\'[[White Stains]]\'\', a [[Decadent movement|Decadent]] collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Symonds|1y=1997|1p=15|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2pp=74?75|3a1=Sutin|3y=2000|3pp=44?45|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=48?50}} In July 1898, he left Cambridge, not having taken any degree at all despite a [[British undergraduate degree classification|\"first class\"]] showing in his 1897 exams and consistent \"second class honours\" results before that.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=78?79|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=35?36}}\n\n===The Golden Dawn: 1898?99===\n[[File:Aleister Crowley, Golden Dawn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Crowley in [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] garb]]\nIn August 1898, Crowley was in [[Zermatt]], Switzerland, where he met the chemist [[Julian L.

He developed a love of Scottish culture, describing himself as the \"Laird of Boleskine\", and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits to London.{{sfnm|1a1=Symonds|1y=1997|1p=29|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2pp=107?111|3a1=Sutin|3y=2000|3pp=72?73|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=68?69|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5p=52}} He continued writing poetry, publishing \'\'Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems\'\', \'\'Tales of Archais\'\', \'\'Songs of the Spirit\'\', \'\'Appeal to the American Republic\'\', and \'\'Jephthah\'\' in 1898?99; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics, although \'\'Jephthah\'\' was considered a particular critical success.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=114?115|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=44?45|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=61, 66, 70}}\n\nCrowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn, and was ready to enter the group\'s inner Second Order.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=115?116|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=71?72|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=64}} He was unpopular in the group; his bisexuality and [[libertine]] lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation, and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including [[W.B.

When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space\'s rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=118?123|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=76?79|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=75?80|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=58?60}} Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers\' authority.{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=27}}\n\n===Mexico, India, Paris, and marriage: 1900?03===\n\nIn 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States, settling in [[Mexico City]] and taking a local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with [[John Dee]]\'s [[Enochian]] invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into [[Freemasonry]] while in the city, and spending time writing, he wrote a play based on [[Richard Wagner]]\'s \'\'[[Tannh?user (opera)|Tannh?user]]\'\' as well as a series of poems, published as \'\'Oracles\'\' (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including [[Iztaccihuatl]], [[Popocatepetl]], and [[Colima (volcano)|Colima]], the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=127?137|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=80?86|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=83?90|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=64?70}} Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence.{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=32}} Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to [[San Francisco]] before sailing for Hawaii aboard the \'\'Nippon Maru\'\'. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; claiming to have fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as \'\'Alice: An Adultery\'\' (1903).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=137?139|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=86?90|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=90?93|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=71?75}}\n\n[[File:Aleister Crowley 1902 K2.jpg|left|thumbnail|Crowley during the K2 Expedition]]\nBriefly stopping at Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying [[Shaivism]].

He spent much of this time studying at the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] in [[Madurai|Madura]], and also wrote poetry which was published as \'\'The Sword of Song\'\' (1904). He contracted [[malaria]], and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=144?147|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=94?98|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=96?98|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=78?83}} In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.&nbsp;Wesseley, and [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]]. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted [[K2]], which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with [[influenza]], malaria, and [[snow blindness]], and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} before turning back.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=148?156|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=98?104|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=98?108|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=83}}\n\nArriving in Paris in November 1902, he hung out with his friend and future brother-in-law, the painter [[Gerald Festus Kelly|Gerald Kelly]], and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene, authoring a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]], published as \'\'Rodin in Rime\'\' (1907).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=159?163|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=104?108|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=109?115|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=84?86}} One of those frequenting this milieu was [[W.

Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as \'\'Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs\'\' (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire \'\'Why Jesus Wept\'\' (1904).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=171?177|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=110?116|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=119?124|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=89?90}}\n\n==Developing Thelema==\n\n===Egypt and \'\'The Book of the Law\'\': 1904===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Had!

Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying [[Islam]]ic [[mysticism]] and [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=181?182|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=118?120|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=124|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=94}} According to Crowley\'s later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him \"they are waiting for you\". On 18 March, she explained that \"they\" were the god [[Horus]], and on 20 March proclaimed that \"the Equinox of the Gods has come\". She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]]; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit\'s number was 666, the [[number of the beast]] in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the \"Stele of Revealing.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=182?183|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=120?122|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=124?126|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=96?98}}\n\nAccording to Crowley\'s own later claims, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of [[Aiwass]], an entity who was the messenger of Horus, or [[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-Paar-Kraat]]. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it \'\'Liber L vel Legis\'\' or \'\'[[The Book of the Law]]\'\'.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184?188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=122?125|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=127?129}} The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]], and that Crowley would serve as its [[prophet]]. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley\'s religion, [[Thelema]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184?188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=125?133}} Crowley claimed that at the time he had been unsure what to do with \'\'The Book of the Law\'\'. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world\'s languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript itself away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}}\n\n===Kangchenjunga and China: 1905?06===\nReturning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=189, 194?195|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=140?141|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=130|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley\'s first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley authoring the pornographic \'\'Snowdrops From a Curate\'s Garden\'\' to entertain his recuperating wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=195?196|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=132|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]. Among its first publications were Crowley\'s \'\'Collected Works\'\', edited by [[Ivor Back]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=190|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=131?133}} His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of ?100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C. Fuller]], a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, \'\'The Star in the West\'\' (1907), heralded Crowley\'s poetry as some of the greatest ever written.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=241?242|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=177?179|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=136?137, 139, 168?169}}\n\n[[File:Kanchenjunga India.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kangchenjunga]], as seen from [[Darjeeling]]]]\n\nCrowley decided to climb [[Kangchenjunga]] in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world\'s most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod|Jacot-Guillarmod]], Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|the expedition]] was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley\'s control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley\'s warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=201?215|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=149?158|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=138?149|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=111?112}}\n\nSpending time in [[Hariharpur, India|Moharbhanj]], where he took part in [[big game hunting]] and wrote the homoerotic work \'\'The Scented Garden\'\', Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] before being forced to leave India after shooting dead a native man who tried to mug him.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=217?219|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=158?162|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=151?152}} Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma, Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China, hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=221|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=162?163|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=114}} Spence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region\'s opium trade.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=33?35|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=115}} Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey, which took the family from [[Tengyueh]] through to [[Yongchang|Yungchang]], [[Dali, Yunnan|Tali]], [[Yunnanfu]], and then [[Hanoi]].

During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of [[Enochian magic]], with Neuburg recording the results, later published in \'\'The Equinox\'\' as \'\'The Vision and the Voice\'\'.

He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|pp=14?21}} Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=12}} The moral code of \"Do What Thou Wilt\" is believed by Thelemites to be the faith\'s ethical law, although academic Marco Pasi noted that this was not [[anarchism|anarchistic]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}}\n\nCrowley believed in the objective existence of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], which he chose to spell \"Magick\". In his book \'\'Magick in Theory and Practice\'\', Crowley defined Magick as \"the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will\".{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=11}} He also told his disciple Karl Germer that \"Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.\"{{Sfn|Churton|2011|p=417}} Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving \'\'The Equinox\'\' the subtitle of \"The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion\".{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=4}}\n\nBoth during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a [[Satanism|Satanist]], usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship [[Satan]], as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist.{{sfnm|1a1=DuQuette|1y=2003|1pp=2?3|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2pp=369?370}} He was also accused of advocating [[human sacrifice]], largely because of a passage in \'\'Book 4\'\' in which he stated that \"A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim\". This was intended as a veiled reference to male [[masturbation]].{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|pp=5?7}}\n\n==Personal life==\nCrowley biographer [[Martin Booth]] asserted that Crowley was \"self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=125}} Similarly, Richard Spence noted that Crowley was \"capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty\".{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=10}} Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a \"blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=148}} The Thelemite [[Lon Milo DuQuette]] noted that Crowley \"was by no means perfect\" and \"often alienated those who loved him dearest.\"{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=9}}\n\nCrowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality,{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=33}} with [[John Symonds]] noting that he \"was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time\".{{sfn|Symonds|1997|p=vii}} Crowley\'s political thought was subjected to an in-depth study by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=23}} Pasi argued that it was difficult to classify Crowley as being either on the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] or [[Right-wing politics|right]], but he was perhaps best categorised as a \"conservative revolutionary\" despite not being affiliated with the German-based [[conservative revolutionary movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=49?50}} Pasi noted that Crowley sympathised with extreme ideologies like [[Nazism]] and [[Marxism-Leninism]], in that they wished to violently overturn society, and hoped that both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union might adopt Thelema.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=52?53}} Crowley described democracy as an \"imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness\",{{sfn|Morgan|2011|p=166}} and commented that \'\'The Book of the Law\'\' proclaimed that \"there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the \'lone wolf\' and the herd\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}} In this attitude he was influenced by the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and by [[Social Darwinism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=129|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=401|3a1=Pasi|3y=2014|3p=48}} Crowley also saw himself as an aristocrat, describing himself as Laird Boleskine; he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=109}} and once described his ideology as \"aristocratic communism\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=50}}\n\nCrowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=67|2a1=Spence|2y=2008|2p=19}} In particular he had an attraction toward \"exotic women\",{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=130}} and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that \"when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived\".{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=91}} Even in later life, he was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=350}} During same-sex [[anal sex|anal intercourse]], he usually played the passive role,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=63|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=159}} which Booth believed \"appealed to his masochistic side\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=63}} Crowley argued that gay and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person \"must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.\"{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=128}} On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=145}}\n\n===Views on race and gender===\nBiographer Lawrence Sutin stated that \"blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley\'s writings\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=223?224}} Sutin thought Crowley \"a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst [[John Bull]] racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries\",{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=2}} noting that he \"embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of their culture, coupled with a fascination with people of colour\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=336}} Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] slurs, and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their \"sublime\" poetry and claimed that the \"Jewish race\" contained \"imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity in an exceptional degree\", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit \"avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|pp=268?269}} He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he claimed that the Chinese people exhibited a \"spiritual superiority\" to the English,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=137}} and praised Muslims for exhibiting \"manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=180}}\n\nCrowley also exhibited a \"general misogyny\" that Booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=61}} Sutin noted that Crowley \"largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=28}} Crowley described women as \"moral inferiors\" who had to be treated with \"firmness, kindness and justice\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=114}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n\nCrowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world.

'Afterlife'	'{{other uses}}\n{{redirect10|After death|Life after death|Hereafter}}\n{{anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:GuideToTheAfterlife-CustodianForGoddessAmun-AltesMuseum-Berlin.png|350px|center]] Ancient Egyptian papyrus depicting the journey into the afterlife.[[File:Anonymous-Paradise of Bhaishajyaguru.jpg|350px|center]] \'\'Paradise of Bhaishajyaguru\'\' discovered at the [[Mogao Caves]].}}\nIn [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[mythology]], and [[fiction]], the \'\'\'afterlife\'\'\' (also referred to as \'\'\'life after death\'\'\' or the \'\'\'Hereafter\'\'\') is the concept of a realm, or the realm itself (whether physical or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]]), in which an [[essence|essential part]] of an individual\'s identity or consciousness continues to exist after [[death|the death of the body]] in the individual\'s lifetime. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an individual, which carries with it and confers personal identity. Belief in an afterlife, which may be [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]]istic or [[supernatural]], is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].\n\nIn some popular views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[Otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].\n\nSome belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by a [[god]], gods, or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of  [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those  in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of another being.\n\n==The afterlife in different metaphysical models==\n{{see also|list of philosophical questions}}\nIn metaphysical models, [[theists]] generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions, tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.\n\nMany religions, whether they believe in the soul\'s existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one\'s status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.\n\n===Reincarnation===\n{{main|Reincarnation}}\nReincarnation refers to an afterlife concept found among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, [[Rosicrucian]]s, [[Theosophy|Theosophists]], [[Spiritism|Spiritists]], and Wiccans. Reincarnation is also a belief described in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] Judaism as gilgul neshamot (Reincarnation of Souls).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectmind.org/exoteric/souls.html |title=Gilgul Neshamot - Reincarnation of Souls |publisher=Projectmind.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> In reincarnation, spiritual development continues after death as the deceased begins another earthly life in the [[Physical plane|physical world]], acquiring a superior grade of consciousness and [[altruism]] by means of successive reincarnations. This succession leads toward an eventual [[salvation|liberation]].\n\nOne consequence of reincarnationist beliefs is that our current lives are both afterlife and a beforelife. According to those beliefs events in our current life are consequences of actions taken in previous lives, or Karma.\n\nRosicrucians,<ref>[[Max Heindel]], The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures ([http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]), 1908, ISBN 0-911274-84-7</ref> in the same way of those who have had [[near-death experiences]], speak of a [[life review]] period occurring immediately after death and before entering the afterlife\'s [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]] (before the [[silver cord]] is broken), followed by a [[Last Judgment#Esoteric Christian tradition|judgment]], more akin to a Final Review or End Report over one\'s life.<ref>Max Heindel, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/death5.htm Death and Life in Purgatory]?[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/death6.htm Life and Activity in Heaven]</ref>\n\n===Heaven and hell===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nIn [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the view is generally held that one goes to [[hell]] or [[heaven]] depending on one\'s deeds or [[faith]] while on Earth, or [[predestination]] and [[Unconditional election]], or to the [[intermediate state]] to await the [[Resurrection of the Dead]]. In most denominations, heaven is a condition of reward for the righteous to go after they die, traditionally defined as eternal union with God.\n\nIn contrast to heaven, hell is a condition of punishment and torment for the wicked, traditionally defined as eternal separation from God and confinement with other sinful souls and fallen angels.\n\n===Limbo===\n{{main|Limbo}}\nDespite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.\n\nIn other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo - definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Purgatory===\n{{main|Purgatory}}\nThe notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God\'s grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory.\n\n[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of \"continuing to grow in holiness there\", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.<ref>Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by \'\'United Methodist Reporter\'\' Managing Editor Robin Russell] and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=4746355&content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]</ref>\n\n==Traditional African religions==\n\n[[Traditional African religion]]s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies such as the [[Hadza people|Hazda]] have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bond|first1=George C.|editor1-last=Obayashi|editor1-first=Hiroshi|title=Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-27906-3|pages=3?18|chapter=Living with Spirits: Death and Afterlife in African Religions|quote=The entire process of death and burial is simple, without elaborate rituals and beliefs in an afterlife.

When the body died, parts of its soul known as \'\'ka\'\' (body double) and the \'\'ba\'\' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.<ref>Richard P. Taylor, \'\'Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia\'\', ABC-CLIO, 2000, ISBN 0-87436-939-8</ref>\n\nArriving at one\'s reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased\'s heart was weighed against the \'\'Shu\'\' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma\'at]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}</ref> If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].<ref>Kathryn Demeritt, \'\'Ptah\'s Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt\'\', 2005, p. 82</ref>\n\nEgyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian \"coffin\" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and \'curses\'. They also used the \"opening of the mouth\".<ref>Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, \'\'Encyclopedia of death and dying\'\', 2001, p. 238</ref><ref>Natalie Lunis, \'\'Tut\'s Deadly Tomb\'\', 2010, p. 11</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became their driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the \'ka\', the \'ba\', and the \'akh\'. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.<ref>Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, \'\'Ancient Egypt\'s Myths and Beliefs\'\', 2011, p. 96</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by User,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archivedate=2011-07-06}}</ref> a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a \'door to the Afterlife\'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].\n\n===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===\n{{main|Greek underworld}}\nThe Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.<ref>F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, \"Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece\", \'\'Acta Theologica\'\' \'\'\'26\'\'\'(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).</ref> The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.<ref>Social Studies School Service, \'\'Ancient Greece\'\', 2003, pp.&nbsp;49?51</ref>\n\n[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased\'s tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.<ref>Perry L. Westmoreland, \'\'Ancient Greek Beliefs\'\', 2007, pp.&nbsp;68?70</ref>\n\nThe Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.\n\nIn \'\'[[Dream of Scipio]]\'\', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.<ref>N. Sabir, \'\'Heaven Hell Or\'\', 2010, p. 147</ref>\n\nIn Book VI of [[Virgil]]\'s \'\'[[Aeneid]]\'\', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas\' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.\n\n===Norse religion===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\nThe [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:\n* [[Valhalla]]: (lit. \"Hall of the Slain\" i.e. \"the Chosen Ones\") Half the warriors who die in battle join the god [[Odin]] who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in [[Asgard]].\n* [[F?lkvangr]]: (lit. \"Field of the Host\") The other half join the goddess [[Freyja]] in a great meadow known as F?lkvangr.\n* [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. \"The Covered Hall\") This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.\n* [[Niflhel]]: (lit. \"The Dark\" or \"Misty Hel\") This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n===Judaism===\n{{main|Jewish eschatology}}\n\n====She\'ol====\nWriting that would later be incorporated into the [[Hebrew Bible]] names [[Sheol]] as the place of the dead.<ref>Harris, Stephen. Understanding the Bible.</ref> The Christian writer\'s traditional re-interpretation is that the Hebrew word Sheol can mean many things, including \"grave\", \"resort\", \"place of waiting\" and \"place of healing\". It can also mean \"deep\", as it is used when the earth opens up and destroys the rebellious Korah, Dathan and Abiram and their 250 followers ({{niv|Numbers|16:31-33|Numbers 16:31-33}}). One might take this as implying that Sheol is literally underground, although it is as easily read literally, as signifying an earthquake or split in the earth.\n\nThe First of the [[Books of Samuel]] 29:3-19 (The [[Eliyahu Koren]] Bible)\n\"Now Samuel was dead...Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who is a medium...and he said...Bring me up Samuel... And Saul knew that it was Samuel... And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am greatly distressed...Then said Samuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord has departed from thee, and is become thy enemy? ... and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.\"\n\n[[Ecclesiastes]]:\n\"For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity. All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?\" ([[Ecclesiastes|Ecc.]] 3:19-21 [[New King James Version|NKJV]])\n\n\"But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share in anything done under the sun.\" (Ecc. 9:4-6 NKJV)\n\nSimilarly Psalms 146:2-4 (NKJV) states:\n\"Do not put your trust in princes, Nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help. His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; In that very day his plans perish.\"\n\nIn the book of Job it is stated:\n\"But man dies and is laid away; indeed he breathes his last and where is he?&nbsp;... So man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more, they will not awake nor be roused from their sleep&nbsp;... If a man dies, shall he live again?\" (Job 14:10,12,14a NKJV)\n\n====Olam Haba====\nThe Talmud offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. Talmudic authorities agree that any virtuous gentile will be given a share in the world-to-come.\nAfter death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the \"[[Olam Haba]]\" or World to Come. Most do not enter the World to Come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a \"re-schooling\", with the soul gaining wisdom as one\'s errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the World to Come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of \"eternal damnation\", so prevalent in other religions, is no tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far much smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] describes the [[Olam Haba]] (\"World to Come\") in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the Messianic era. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was \"housed\" during its earthly existence.\n\nThe [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)Section - Question 12.8: What do Jews say happens when a person dies?

Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}</ref> the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nShraga Simmons commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi - Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\nYirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an \"ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism\". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. Onkelos, a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, \"Let Reuben live and not die&nbsp;...\" (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195?1270), attributed Job\'s suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job\'s saying \"God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&nbsp;... the light of the living\' (Job 33:29,30).\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation ?

Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]\'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.<ref>Martin Buber, \"Legende des Baalschem\" in \'\'Die Chassidischen B?cher\'\', Hellerau 1928, especially \'\'Die niedergestiegene Seele\'\'</ref>\n\nAmong well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: \"beliefs and opinions\") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While refuting reincarnation, the Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.\n\nOther well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}</ref> and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.\n\nAmong the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His \'\'[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]\'\', \"The Gates of Reincarnation\", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.\n\nRabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that ?Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

[[eschatology|Eschatological]] passages are found in many places, especially [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Olivet discourse|Matthew 24]], [[The Sheep and the Goats|Matthew 25]], and the [[Book of Revelation]]. Although punishments are made part of certain Christian conceptions of the afterlife, the prevalent concept of \"eternal damnation\" is a tenet of the Christian afterlife.\n\nWhen questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who one\'s spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be (at least in this respect) like the [[angels]] in heaven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&version=47; |title=Matthew 22:23-33 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\nJesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXD.HTM |title=The New American Bible - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]], at the death of Jesus tombs were opened, and at [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]] many [[saints]] who had died emerged from their tombs and went into \"the holy city\", presumably [[New Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2027:50-54;&version=47; |title=Matthew 27:50-54 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> No other New Testament account includes this event.\n\n\'\'\'The Last Day\'\'\': Jesus compared the [[Kingdom of God|kingdom of heaven]], over which He rules, to a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.

The angels will separate the evil from the [[righteous]] and throw them into [[Hell in Christian beliefs|the furnace of unquenchable fire]]. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their [[God the Father|Father]].\n\nThe [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.<ref>[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper & Brothers. 1956. page 276.</ref> It should be noted that the Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.\n\nThe book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.\n\n[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]\'s \'\'Inferno\'\': a Christian vision of hell]]\nThe author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].\n\nThe non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of [[prayer for the dead]], so that they might be \"translated to a state of happiness\".<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5</ref>\n\n[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures the [[underworld]] ([[Hades]]) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the \"[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]\" into which they are destined to be cast.\n\nGregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.<ref>He wrote that a person \"may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, \'\'after his departure out of the body\'\', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been \'\'purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire\'\'\" (emphasis added)?Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory]</ref>\n\nPope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of \"purgatorial flames\".\n\nThe noun [[Purgatory|\"purgatorium\"]] (Latin: place of cleansing<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory \"purgatory\"]. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003.

A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is \'\'[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]\'\'.<ref name=\"swedenborgdigitallibrary.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html |title=Swedenborg, E. \'&#39;Heaven and its Wonders and Hell.

Many deist freethinkers held that belief in an afterlife with reward and punishment was a necessity of reason and good morals.\n\nMost Christians deny that entry into Heaven can be properly earned, rather it is a gift that is solely God\'s to give through his unmerited grace. This belief follows the theology of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]: \'\'For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith?and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.\'\' The [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]], [[Thomist]], [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]], and [[Calvinist]] theological traditions all emphasize the necessity of God\'s undeserved grace for salvation, and reject so-called [[Pelagianism]], which would make man earn salvation through [[good works]]. Not all Christian sects accept this doctrine, leading to many controversies on [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] and [[free will]], and the idea of [[predestination]]. In particular, the belief that heaven is a reward for good behavior is a common folk belief in Christian societies, even among members of churches which reject that belief.\n\nSome Christian believers have come to downplay the punishment of hell. [[Universalists]] teach that salvation is for all. Jehovah\'s Witnesses and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], though they have among the strictest rules on how to conduct their lives, teach that sinners are destroyed rather than tortured forever. John 3:16 says that only those that accept Jesus will be given [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], so the people that do not accept him cannot burn in hell for eternity because Jesus has not given them eternal life, instead it says they will perish.\n\nIn American pop culture depictions of Heaven, particularly in vintage cartoons such as those by [[Looney Tunes]] in the mid-20th century, the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of virtuous people ascend to Heaven and are converted into [[angels]]. However, this is not in accordance with the orthodox Christian theology. Christianity depicts a sharp distinction between \'\'angels\'\', divine beings created by God before the creation of humanity and are used as messengers, and \'\'saints\'\', the souls of humans who have received immortality from the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who dwell in Heaven [[Beatific Vision|with God]].\n\nLatter Day Saints believe that the soul existed before earth life and will exist in the hereafter. Angels are either spirits that have not yet come to earth to experience their mortality, or spirits or resurrected beings that have already passed through mortality and do the will of God. See Job 38:4-7, D&C 93:29. According to LDS Doctrine, Michael the Archangel became the first man on earth, Adam, to experience his mortality. The Angel of Moroni visited the boy, Joseph Smith, after living out his mortal life in ancient America. Later, he received Angelic administrations from the Apostles Peter, James, and John, John the Baptist, and others.\n\n====The Catholic Church====\nThe Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that [[Particular judgment|after the body dies, the soul is judged]], the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner\'s self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.\n\n====Orthodox Christianity====\nThe Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that \"the \'location\' of one?s final destiny?heaven or hell?as being figurative.\"<ref name=\"Andrew P. Klager 2011\">Andrew P. Klager, \"Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa\'s \'\'De vita Moysis\'\': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion,\" In \'\'Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend\'\', eds. Ted Grimsrud & Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2011), 245.</ref> Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one\'s uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. \"The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience.\"<ref name=\"Andrew P. Klager 2011\"/> For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that \"those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability.\"<ref>St. Isaac the Syrian, \"Homily 28,\" In \'\'The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,\'\' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.</ref> In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.  Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus\' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: \"19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.? As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, \"[I]t is precisely the presence of God?s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be ?all and in all,? with boundless mercy and uncondi- tional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God?s gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain.\"<ref>Fr. Thomas Hopko, ?Foreword,? in \'\'The Orthodox Church\'\', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir\'s Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.</ref>\n\nMoreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of \'\'[[apokatastasis]]\'\', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]], whom [[Maximos the Confessor]] called the \"universal doctor\" and the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 C.E.) not only called him the \"father of fathers\" but also affirmed his orthodoxy while also simultaneously condemning Origen\'s brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn\'t teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Cl?ment]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].<ref>Andrew P. Klager, \"Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa\'s \'\'De vita Moysis\'\': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion,\" In \'\'Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend\'\', eds. Ted Grimsrud & Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2011), 251.</ref> Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a [[wikt:theologoumenon#English|theologoumena]], it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.  As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, \"It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,?<ref>Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.</ref> as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.\n\n====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====\n{{main|plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}\n[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the Afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness?a spirit prison or \"hell\" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham\'s Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison (1 Peter 3:18-20) and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. \'\'\"--- what Jesus\' immortal spirit did after His death and before His Resurrection is a mystery to all but the Latter-day Saints ---\" (Elder Spencer J. Condie, Liahona, -Church magazine ? July, 2003) \"- - - unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant - - his voice was not raised. - - But behold, from among the righteous, He organized His forces and appointed messengers&nbsp;...\" (D&C 138:20, 30?32). \"Christ opened the doors of hell to missionary work among the dead&nbsp;...\" (H. Donl Peterson, \"I Have a Question\", Ensign, Apr. 1986, 36?38).\'\' This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned \"permanently\" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived? Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever. (See Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.)\n\nThe Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to True to the Faith, (A handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith) \"The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have ?received the testimony of Jesus? and been ?made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood? (D&C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins.\"<ref>https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng</ref>\n\n====Jehovah\'s Witnesses====\n[[Jehovah\'s Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as \"afterlife\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=April 1, 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}</ref> to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168?175}}</ref> Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife.

Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.<ref>{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures|volume=2|pages=574?576}}</ref> After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).\n\n====Seventh-day Adventists====\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah\'s Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as \"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten\" (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]]. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus\' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are \"asleep\". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever.(Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)<ref>White, E.G.

The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is \'\'[[Jannah]]\'\' and Hell is \'\'[[Jahannam]]\'\'. Their level of comfort while in the grave depends wholly on their level of \'\'[[Iman (concept)|Iman]]\'\' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being [[God]] or [[Allah]]. In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy Iman one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of Iman chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire \'\'[[Tasbih]]\'\' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as \"SubahannAllah\" or [[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah over and over again to acquire good deeds.\n\nIslam teaches that the purpose of Man\'s entire creation is to worship the Creator of the Heavens and Earth (Allah) alone that includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual\'s ultimate abode be it punishment or \'\'Jannat\'\' in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.\n\n\'\'Jannah\'\' and \'\'Jahannam\'\' both have different levels. \'\'Jannah\'\' has seven gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. \'\'Jahannam\'\' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.\n\nIn the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&_pos=1 |title=Afterlife - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\nA central doctrine of the Qur\'an is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.\n\nUntil the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.\n\nThe resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: \"Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them\"?).\n\nOn the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One\'s eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.\n\n====Ahmadiyya====\n\n[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an \"embryonic soul\" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one\'s own\'s rights over that of other\'s becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and Peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=elementary+study+of+islam&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bnk9U8PPJMGm0QXe94HoDQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam&f=false | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-562-5}}</ref>\n\n====Sufi====\nThe Sufi scholar [[Ibn \'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or \"isthmus\". It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, ?is anything that separates two things?. It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.<ref name=\"Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64?8, 73,75?8, 82, 102\">{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n,50n, 59, 64?8, 73, 75?8, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}</ref>\n\n===Bah?\'?

It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha\'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.<ref name=\"PSmith\"/>\n\n==Indian religions==\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n{{main|Hindu eschatology}}\nThe [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (\'\'punarjanma\'\') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, the Lord [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called \"Mukti\" (Sanskrit: ??????) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is \"[[Moksha]]\" (Sanskrit: ?????) or salvation.\n\nThe [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person\'s body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person\'s timings & deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama\'s assistant, Chitragupta.\n\nAccording to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.\n\nThe soul, called \"[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]\" leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or Karma performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad Karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad Karmas in \"[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]\" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in \"svarga\" or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as \"Mrutyulok\" or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only & only yajna karma (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as \"Moksha\" or \"Nirvana\", which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. Atma  moves with \"Parmatma\" or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an \"Atma\" or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements?Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of \"Narkas\" or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad Karmas and dealt with accordingly.\n\nHindus also believe in \'Karma\'. \'Karma\' is the accumulated sums of one\'s good or bad deeds. Satkarma means good deeds, vikarma means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of Karma is \'As you sow, you shall reap\'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good \'Karma\' brings good rewards and bad \'karmas\' lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus \"Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a \'\'kshatriya\'\' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles.\"\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n{{main|Buddhist eschatology}}\nBuddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=0-585-03949-6 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}</ref> The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person\'s actions (kamma or [[karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.\n\nYet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to Theravada Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.\n\nPure Land Buddhism of Mahayana believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called Pure Land. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha\'s name.\n\nIn [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.\n\n\"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition.\"\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n[[Sikhism]] has a very strong belief in after life. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it\'s been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism\'s belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in Guru Granth sahib, but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.\n\nBut if one analyse the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions Afterlife, existence of heaven and hell are mentioned succinctly in Guru Granth Sahib and in Dasam granth so from that it can been concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell, however, heaven and hell are created to reward and punish, one will then take birth again until one merges in God.  According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. That is a higher philosophy. It?s like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. You?re just changing one form into another one. Actually, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.<ref>http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1248308791&ucat=7</ref>\n\n==Neopaganism==\n\n===Wicca===\nThe Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.<ref>Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own - Page 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock - 2005</ref>\n\n==Others==\n\n===Shinto===\n{{further|Shinto#Afterlife}}\n\n===Unitarian Universalism===\nSome [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bond|first1=Jon|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.<ref>The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism - Page 147, Mark W.

Can There Be Common Ground? - Page 582, Robyn E. Lebron - 2012</ref>\n\n===Spiritualism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nIn [[spiritualism]], the afterlife realm, known as the \"plane of Venus\", was described by [[Edgar Cayce]]. Venus, as an afterlife realm, is not a reference to the planet. It is a reference to the afterlife realm for which the planet Venus physically represents. Venus is the afterlife realm where love is dominant. Cayce says of Venus,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n{{quote|In Venus we find the lovely becoming the expressions in activities in which there is the beauty seen in love, in companionship, in association, in music, in art, in all the things that bespeak of the loveliness even of nature and material things, rather than the expression of same in the earthly form or manner.}}\n\nAccording to Cayce, this afterlife realm can be referred to as the realm of love. Sympathy, the alleviating of hardships, the seeking of love, beauty and song are some influences that people from that realm possess. Beauty, either natural or man-made, will move these individuals; furthermore, there is a desire to beautify the home. There is a strong attraction to the opposite sex. This dimension is an indescribably lovely existence. Here one must leave behind all rigid intellectual structures and dogmas, be they scientific, religious, or philosophical. An infinite variety of new sounds, colors and feelings are experienced here and souls find a much wider freedom to function with highly energized intellect and spirit. If, in this dimension, the soul becomes free from the Earth pull, it is qualified to experience cosmic ranges beyond Earth\'s confines.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Zoroastrianism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\n{{main|Frashokereti}}\nZoroastrianism states that the \'\'urvan\'\', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul\'s good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (V?zar??a), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).\n\n[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima\'s realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.\n\nRituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.\n\n[[Misvan Gatu]] is the \'place of the mixed ones\' where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu\'s scale is equal.\n\n==Parapsychology==\n{{Main|Parapsychology}}\n{{See also|Near-death studies|Near death experience}}\n\nThe [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].\n\nParapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].<ref>David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife.

According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in [[God]], who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as [[David Ray Griffin]] have written that people may have subjective experience after death.<ref>Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York, 1984) p.&nbsp;32?36</ref><ref>David Griffin, \"The Possibility of Subjective Immortality in Whitehead\'s Philosophy,\" in The Modern Schoolman, LIII, November. 1975, pp.&nbsp;39?51.</ref><ref>[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&C=2598 What Is Process Theology? by Robert B.

The information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the [[kinematics]] and physical origin of the [[Solar System]] and our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thousandau1 space probe.jpg|thumb|Concept art for the TAU spacecraft, a 1980s era study which would have used an interstellar precursor probe to expand the baseline for calculating stellar parallax in support of Astrometry]]\nThe history of astrometry is linked to the history of [[star catalogue]]s, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to [[Hipparchus]], who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]] to discover Earth\'s [[precession]]. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today.<ref>Walter, Hans G. (2000).</ref> Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star maps: history, artistry, and cartography |first=Nick |last=Kanas |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=109 |isbn=0-387-71668-8}}</ref> Hipparchus\'s successor, [[Ptolemy]], included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the \'\'[[Almagest]]\'\', giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.<ref>p. 110, Kanas 2007.</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] carried out observations on the stars and described their positions, [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s and [[star color]], and gave drawings for each constellation, in his \'\'[[Book of Fixed Stars]]\'\'. [[Ibn Yunus]] observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun\'s position for many years using a large [[astrolabe]] with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on [[eclipse]]s were still used centuries later in [[Simon Newcomb]]\'s investigations on the motion of the Moon, while his other observations inspired [[Laplace]]\'s \'\'Obliquity of the Ecliptic\'\' and \'\'Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn\'\'.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1895AJ.....15..113L Great Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn]</ref> In the 15th century, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]] compiled the \'\'[[Zij-i-Sultani]]\'\', in which he catalogued 1,019 stars.

The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his [[telescope]], but he instead discovered the [[aberration of light]] and the [[nutation]] of the Earth\'s axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by [[Friedrich Bessel]], the father of modern astrometry. He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]] for the [[binary star]] [[61 Cygni]].\n\nBeing very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the [[filar micrometer]]. [[Astrograph]]s using astronomical [[photographic plate]]s sped the process in the early 20th century.  Automated plate-measuring machines<ref>[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1107461 CERN paper on plate measuring machine] USNO StarScan</ref> and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of [[star catalogue]]s. In the 1980s, [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond. This technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.\n\nIn 1989, the [[European Space Agency]]\'s [[Hipparcos]] satellite took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the Earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere. Operated from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes. During its 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and [[proper motions]] of 118,218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. A new \"[[Hipparcos Catalogue|Tycho catalog]]\" drew together a database of 1,058,332 to within 20-30 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|mas]] (milliarcseconds). Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double/multiple stars and 11,597 [[variable star]]s also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.<ref>{{cite web\n | author=Staff | date=1 June 2007\n | url=http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS\n | title=The Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission\n | publisher=European Space Agency\n | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nToday, the catalogue most often used is [[Star catalogue#USNO-B1.0|USNO-B1.0]], an all-sky catalogue that tracks proper motions, positions, magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects. During the past 50 years, 7,435 [[Schmidt camera]] plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in USNO-B1.0 accurate to within 0.2 arcsec.<ref>Kovalevsky, Jean (1995).</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:orbit3.gif|thumb|right|200px|Diagram showing how a smaller object (such as an [[extrasolar planet]]) orbiting a larger object (such as a [[star]]) could produce changes in position and velocity of the latter as they orbit their common [[center of mass]] (red cross).]]\n[[Image:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|right|200px|Motion of [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of solar system relative to the Sun.]]\nApart from the fundamental function of providing [[astronomer]]s with a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like [[celestial mechanics]], [[stellar dynamics]] and [[galactic astronomy]]. In [[observational astronomy]], astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is basically the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time]] synchronized to [[Earth]]\'s rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry is an important step in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] because it establishes [[parallax]] distance estimates for stars in the [[Milky Way]].\n\nAstrometry has also been used to support claims of [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|extrasolar planet detection]] by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star\'s apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Although, as of 2009, none of the extrasolar planets detected by ground-based astrometry has been verified in subsequent studies, astrometry is expected to be more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth\'s atmosphere.<ref>Nature  462, 705 (2009) 8 December 2009 {{doi|10.1038/462705a}}</ref> NASA\'s planned [[Space Interferometry Mission]] ([[SIM PlanetQuest]]) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect [[terrestrial planet]]s orbiting 200 or so of the nearest [[Solar analog|solar-type stars]], and the European Space Agency\'s [[Gaia Mission]], launched in 2013, which will be applying astrometric techniques in its stellar census.<ref>[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/120377_index_0_m.html] ESA - Space Science - Gaia overview</ref>\n\nAstrometric measurements are used by [[astrophysicist]]s to constrain certain models in [[celestial mechanics]]. By measuring the velocities of [[pulsar]]s, it is possible to put a limit on the [[asymmetry]] of [[supernova]] explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.\n\nAstronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of [[near-Earth objects]]. Astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by Earth?s motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, including its [[orbital elements]], can be obtained.<ref>{{cite web\n | first=Chadwick | last=Trujillo | author2=Rabinowitz, David\n | date=1 June 2007\n | url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/%7Embrown/papers/ps/sedna.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=Discovery of a candidate inner Oort cloud planetoid\n | publisher=European Space Agency\n | accessdate=2007-12-06 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071026202421/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/sedna.pdf| archivedate= 26 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n[[50000 Quaoar]] and [[90377 Sedna]] are two Solar System objects discovered in this way by [[Michael E.

She is the [[Virginity|virgin]] patroness of [[Athens]]. The Athenians founded the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis]] of her namesake city, Athens (Athena Parthenos), in her honour.<ref name=\"Deacy, Susan 2001\"/>\n\nVeneration of Athena was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes. In her role as a protector of the city (\'\'[[polis]]\'\'), many people throughout the Greek world worshipped Athena as \'\'Athena Polias\'\' (????? ?????? \"Athena of the city\"). While the city of Athens and the goddess Athena essentially bear the same name (\'\'Athena\'\' the goddess, \'\'Athenai\'\' the city), it is not known which of the two words is derived from the other.<ref>\"Whether the goddess was named after the city or the city after the goddess is an ancient dispute\" (Burkert 1985:139)</ref>\n\n==Etymology of the name and origins of her cult==\nAthena is associated with [[Athens]], a plural name, because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the \'\'Athenai\'\', in earliest times. [[Mycenae]] was the city where the Goddess was called Mykene, and Mycenae is named in the plural for the sisterhood of females who tended her there. At [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] she was called Thebe, and the city again a plural, Thebae (or Thebes, where the ?s? is the plural formation). Similarly, at Athens she was called Athena, and the city Athenae (or Athens, again a plural).<ref>Ruck and Staples 1994:24.</ref>\n\nAthena had a special relationship with [[Athens]], as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city. According to mythical lore, she competed with Poseidon and she won by creating the olive tree; the Athenians would accept her gift and name the city after her. In history, the citizens of Athens built a statue of Athena as a temple to the goddess, which had piercing eyes, a helmet on her head, attired with an [[aegis]] or [[cuirass]], and an extremely long spear. It also had a crystal shield with the head of the Gorgon on it. A large snake accompanied her and she held [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory, in her hand.\n\nIn a [[Mycenea]]n fresco, there is a composition of two women extending their hands towards a central figure who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield and could also depict the war-goddess with her [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladium]], or her palladium in an aniconic representation. Therefore, Mylonas believes that Athena was a Mycenaean creation.<ref>G.

When [[Pericles]] was in distress about this, the goddess [Athena] appeared to him at night in a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion it was that he set up a brass statue of Athena Hygeia, in the citadel near the altar, which they say was there before.

([[Pindar]], \'\'Seventh Olympian Ode\'\'). Plato, in the \'\'[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\'\', attributes the cult of Athena to the culture of [[Crete]], introduced, he thought, from Libya during the dawn of Greek culture. Classical myths thereafter note that [[Hera]] was so annoyed at Zeus for having produced a child that she conceived and bore [[Hephaestus]] by [[parthenogenesis|herself]], but in Philostratus the Elder, Imagines [https://archive.org/stream/imagines00philuoft#page/246/mode/2up 2. 27] (trans.

A distant archaic separate entity named Pallas is invoked as Athena\'s father, sister, foster sister, companion, or opponent in battle. One of these is [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]], a daughter of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] (a sea god), and a childhood friend of Athena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePallas.html |title=Pallas |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIn every case, Athena kills Pallas, accidentally, and thereby gains the name for herself. In one telling, they practice the arts of war together until one day they have a falling out. As Pallas is about to strike Athena, Zeus intervenes. With Pallas stunned by a blow from Zeus, Athena takes advantage and kills her. Distraught over what she has done, Athena takes the name Pallas for herself.\n\nWhen Pallas is Athena\'s father, the events, including her birth, are located near a body of water named Triton or [[Lake Tritonis|Tritonis]]. When Pallas is Athena\'s sister or foster-sister, Athena\'s father or foster-father is [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], the son and herald of [[Poseidon]]. But Athena may be called the daughter of Poseidon and a nymph named Tritonis, without involving Pallas. Likewise, Pallas may be Athena\'s father or opponent, without involving Triton.<ref>Graves, Robert, \'\'The Greek Myths I\'\', \"The Birth of Athena\", 8.a., p. 51. The story comes from [[Libya]]n (modern [[Berber people|Berbers]]) where the Greek Athena and the Egyptian [[Neith]] blend into one deity. The story is not often referenced because some of the details are contradicted by other, better-documented theories. Frazer, vol. 2 p.41</ref> On this topic, Walter Burkert says \"she is the Pallas of Athens, \'\'Pallas Athenaie\'\', just as Hera of Argos is \'\'Here Argeie\'\'.<ref>Burkert, p. 139.</ref> For the Athenians, Burkert notes, Athena was simply \"the Goddess\", \'\'h? the?s\'\' (? ????), certainly an ancient title.\n\n[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|[[The Parthenon]], Temple of Athena Parthenos]]\n\n===\'\'Athena Parthenos\'\': Virgin Athena===\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:RiddleAthena.jpg|thumb|The modern \'\'Athena Parthenos\'\', a replica of the statue that stood in her temple on the [[Acropolis]], including the Nike in her hand and the serpent, Erichthonius, behind her shield which stands in the replicated [[Parthenon]] in [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]], [[Nashville]] [[Tennessee]]]] -->\n\nAthena never had a consort or lover and is thus known as \'\'[[Athena Parthenos]]\'\', \"Virgin Athena\". Her most famous temple, the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]] takes its name from this title. It is not merely an observation of her virginity, but a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity as it upheld a rudiment of female behavior in the patriarchal society. Kerenyi\'s study and theory of Athena accredits her virginal epithet to be a result of the relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.<ref>K.Kerenyi,\'\'Die Jungfrau und Mutter der griechischen Religion.

Athena then raised the baby as a foster mother.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAthena puts the infant Erichthonius into a small box (\'\'cista\'\') which she entrusts to the care of three sisters, [[Herse]], [[Pandrosus]], and [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglaulus]] of Athens. The goddess does not tell them what the box contains, but warns them not to open it until she returns. One or two sisters opens the \'\'cista\'\' to reveal Erichthonius, in the form (or embrace) of a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. The serpent, or insanity induced by the sight, drives Herse and Aglaulus to throw themselves off the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]].<ref>Graves, Robert, \'\'The Greek Myths I\'\', \"The Nature and Deeds of Athena\" 25.d.</ref>  Jane Harrison (\'\'Prolegomena\'\') finds this to be a simple cautionary tale directed at young girls carrying the \'\'cista\'\' in the [[Thesmophoria]] rituals, to discourage them from opening it outside the proper context.\n\n<!-- Her role as the virgin mother of [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] was a relic of an archaic myth of the patron goddess of \'\'Athenai\'\' that preceded her placement among the Olympian pantheon. -->\nAnother version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in \'\'[[Metamorphoses]]\'\' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC ? 17 AD); in this late variant [[Hermes]] falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus\'s greed, Athena asks the goddess [[Invidia|Envy]] to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.<ref>[[Ovid]], \'\'Metamorphoses\'\', X. Aglaura, Book II, 708?751; XI. The Envy, Book II, 752?832.</ref>\n\nWith this mythic origin, Erichthonius became the founder-[[king of Athens]], and many beneficial changes to Athenian culture were ascribed to him. During this time, Athena frequently protected him.\n\n====Medusa and Tiresias====\nIn a late myth, [[Medusa]], unlike her sister [[Gorgon]]s, came to be viewed by the Greeks of the 5th century as a beautiful mortal that served as priestess in Athena\'s temple. Poseidon liked Medusa, and decided to rape her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm |title= Medusa in Myth and Literary History |accessdate= 2010-01-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123102204/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm| archivedate= 23 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa\'s form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa\'s hair turned into snakes, her lower body was transformed also, and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone. In the earliest myths, there is only one [[Gorgon]], but there are two snakes that form a belt around her waist.\n\nIn one version of the [[Tiresias]] myth, Tiresias stumbled upon Athena bathing, and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see. But having lost his eyesight, he was given a special gift?to be able to understand the language of the birds (and thus to foretell the future).\n\n[[File:AttalusICorrected.jpg|thumb|Athena depicted on a coin of [[Attalus I]], ruler of [[Pergamon]]; c. 200 BC.]]\n\n===Lady of Athens===\nAthena competed with [[Poseidon]] to be the patron deity of Athens, which was yet unnamed, in a version of one [[founding myth]]. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his [[trident]] and a salt water spring sprang up; this gave them a means of trade and water?Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]]?but the water was salty and not very good for drinking.<ref name=\"Graves 1960:16.3p 62\">Graves 1960:16.3p 62.</ref>\n\nAthena, however, offered them the first domesticated [[olive tree]]. The Athenians (or their king, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]]) accepted the olive tree and with it the patronage of Athena, for the olive tree brought wood, oil, and food. [[Robert Graves]] was of the opinion that \"Poseidon\'s attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths\" which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.<ref name=\"Graves 1960:16.3p 62\"/>\n\n====Other cult sites====\nAthena also was the patron goddess of several other Greek cities, notably Sparta, where the archaic cult of [[Athena Alea]] had its sanctuaries in the surrounding villages of [[Mantineia]] and, notably, [[Tegea]].  In Sparta itself, the temple of Athena \'\'Khalk?oikos\'\' (Athena \"of the Brazen House\", often [[latin]]ized as \'\'Chalcioecus\'\') was the grandest and located on the Spartan acropolis; presumably it had a roof of bronze. The forecourt of the Brazen House was the place where the most solemn religious functions in Sparta took place.\n\nTegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece,<ref>\"This sanctuary had been respected from early days by all the [[Peloponnesian]]s, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants\" (Pausanias, \'\'Description of Greece\'\'  iii.5.6)</ref> containing the Temple of [[Athena Alea]]. The \'\'temenos\'\' was founded by [[Aleus]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed.<ref>Pausanias, \'\'Description of Greece\'\' viii.4.8.</ref> Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are sealstone and [[fibula]]e. In the Archaic period the nine villages that underlie Tegea banded together in a [[synoecism]] to form one city.<ref>Compare the origin of [[Sparta]].</ref> Tegea was listed in [[Homer]]\'s [[Catalogue of Ships]] as one of the cities that contributed ships and men for the [[War of Troy|Achaean assault on Troy]].\n<!--Another interesting and arguable reason for why the Athenians chose Athena\'s olive tree over Poseidon\'s horses and spring was because Poseidon was known to be a very difficult deity to please and often wrought havoc even upon his cities. Athena was a better choice because of her less violent personality and the Athenians did not wish to have to encounter Poseidon\'s wrath in future. Poseidon and Athena may also be viewed as foils for one another; Athena girding order and civility in approaching conflicts and Poseidon unleashing rage without moderation. Poseidon lords over the horses and lets them run rampant while Athena produces the bridle and chariot so that the horse may be tamed.<ref>M.Detienne,\"Athena and the Mastery of the Horse\", History of Religions(161-184).Hassocks:Harvester Press,1991.</ref> Civilization needed the tranquility and resourcefulness of Athena much more than an uninhibited temper.\n{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}-->\n\n===Counselor===\n[[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2648.jpg|thumb|Athena and Heracles on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], 480?470 BC.]]\n\nLater myths of the Classical Greeks relate that Athena guided [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] in his quest to behead [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]. She instructed [[Heracles]] to skin the [[Nemean Lion]] by using its own claws to cut through its thick hide. She also helped Heracles to defeat the [[Stymphalian Birds]], and to navigate the underworld so as to capture [[Cerberus]].\n\nIn \'\'[[The Odyssey]]\'\', [[Odysseus]]\' cunning and shrewd nature quickly won Athena\'s favour. In the realistic epic mode, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from \'\'afar\'\', as by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the \"protectress of heroes\" or as mythologian [[Walter Friedrich Otto]] dubbed her the \"goddess of nearness\" due to her mentoring and motherly probing.<ref>W.F.Otto,\'\'Die Gotter Griechenlands(55-77)\'\'.Bonn:F.Cohen,1929</ref> It is not until he washes up on the shore of an island where [[Nausicaa]] is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa\'s dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca.\n\nAthena appears in disguise to Odysseus upon his arrival, initially lying and telling him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead; but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself.<ref>Trahman in \'\'Phoenix\'\', p. 35.</ref> Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly man or beggar so that he cannot be noticed by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors.\n\nShe also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors\' relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill the father of Antinous, Eupeithes.\n\n===Judgment of Paris===\n{{Main|Judgement of Paris}}\nIn one myth, all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]). Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word ???????? (kallist?i, \"for the fairest\"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.\n\n[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|bottom|Paris is awarding the apple to Aphrodite \'\'Urteil des Paris\'\' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], c. 1857]]\n\nThe goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince. After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. The goddesses undressed before him to be evaluated, either at his request or by their own choice.\n\nStill, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with control over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], while Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite came forth and whispered to Paris that if he were to choose her as the fairest he would have the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]]. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen\'s abduction by Paris they brought about the [[Trojan War]].\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Judgment of Paris - WGA05252.jpg|thumb|The apple is being given to Paris in alternative interpretations - [[Cornelis van Haarlem]], 1628]]\n\nAnother interpretation is that the apple was being given to the man by the three goddesses, instead of to one of the goddesses. This is the interpretation mythologists and writers delving into more ancient Greek myths that date from before the classical period. The later interpretation is considered a variant interpretation of icons of great antiquity, to conform to the changes in the evolution of the Greek pantheon in myths.\n\nIt is suspected that the icons relate to a religious ritual in which a \"king\" was selected who would serve for a year (or a specified period) before being sacrificed and that the cycle would be renewed upon his death. [[Robert Graves]] was a strong proponent of this theory and it is written about in many of his publications, such as \'\'[[The Greek Myths]]\'\' and \'\'[[The White Goddess]]\'\'. This also was suggested in the early versions of an extensive analysis of Greek mythology, \'\'[[The Golden Bough]]\'\' by [[James George Frazer]]. In a later editions Frazer completely revised the book and left out his research and discussion of these rituals in the abbreviated edition that is known by that title today.\n\nThese interpretations relate to a concept of a \'\'Great Goddess\'\', a \'\'[[Mother Goddess]]\'\', and the religious worship of such a deity in very ancient Greek culture. It took a triad form, one phase being Athena along with Hera and Aphrodite and others in her matrilineal line (grandmother, mother, etc.) such as ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], [[Hera]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]), and myths that arose through interpretations (or misinterpretations) of icons from earlier cultural periods. The apple would have been given to the \"king\" the three goddesses selected.\n\n===Roman fable of Arachne===\nThe [[fable]] of [[Arachne]] is a late Roman addition to Classical [[Greek mythology]]<ref>The Arachne narrative is in [[Ovid]]\'s \'\'[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]\'\' (vi.5-54 and 129-145) and mentioned in [[Virgil]]\'s \'\'[[Georgics]]\'\', iv, 246.</ref> but does not appear in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne\'s name means \'\'spider\'\'.<ref>{{LSJ|a)ra/xnh|??????}}, {{LSJ|a)ra/xnhs|???????|ref}}.</ref> Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in [[Tyrian purple]] in Hypaipa of [[Lydia]], and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.\n\nAthena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.\n\nAthena wove the scene of her victory over [[Poseidon]] that had inspired her patronage of Athens. According to Ovid\'s Latin narrative, Arachne\'s tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the infidelity of the deities, including [[Zeus]] being unfaithful with [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], with [[Europa (mythical)|Europa]], and with [[Dana?]]. Athena admitted that Arachne\'s work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne\'s offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne\'s tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle.\n\nAthena then struck Arachne with her staff, which changed her into a spider. In some versions, the destruction of her loom leads Arachne to hang herself in despair; Athena takes pity on her, and transforms her into a spider. In the aforementioned version, Arachne weaved scenes of joy while Athena weaved scenes of horror.\n\nThe fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].<!--no citation required: this is merely the superficial reading-->\n\n===A changed status in classical mythology===\nIn [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] mythology the role of Athena changed as the pantheon became organized under the leadership of Zeus. In earlier mythology she is identified as a [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]] daughter of a goddess, but the classical myths fashion for her a peculiar \"birth from the head of Zeus\" that assigns a father for Athena and eliminates a mother for her, identifying the father as a deity who at one time was portrayed as her brother. Athens may have fallen in 404 BC but the cult of Athena was so dominant in the culture that it survived the transitions seen in the mythic roles of other goddesses, albeit with a juggling of \"family\" relationships.\n\nJ.J. Bachofen advocated that Athena was originally a maternal figure stable in her security and poise but was caught up and perverted by a patriarchal society; this was especially the case in Athens. The goddess adapted but could very easily be seen as a god. He viewed it as \"motherless paternity in the place of fatherless maternity\" where once altered, Athena\'s character was to be crystallized as that of a patriarch.<ref>J.J. Bachofen.\"Mother Right:An investigation of religious and juridical character of matriarchy in the ancient world\",\'\'Myth, Religion and Mother Right\'\'.London:Routledge and Kegan Paul,1967.</ref>\n\nWhereas Bachofen saw the switch to paternity on Athena\'s behalf as an increase of power, Freud on the contrary perceived Athena as an \"original mother goddess divested of her power\". In this interpretation, Athena was demoted to be only Zeus\'s daughter, never allowed the expression of motherhood. Still more different from Bachofen\'s perspective is the lack of role permanency in Freud\'s view: Freud held that time and differing cultures would mold Athena to stand for what was necessary to them.<ref>Shearer,\'\'Athene\'\',224-235.</ref>\n\nSome modern authors classify the changes as an \"androgynous compromise\" that allowed her traits and what she stood for to be attributed to male and female rulers alike over the course of history (such as [[Marie de\' Medici]], [[Anne of Austria]], [[Christina of Sweden]], and [[Catherine the Great]]).<ref>F.Zeitlin,\"The Dynamics of Misogyny:Myth and Mythmaking in the Oresteia\",\'\'Arethusa\'\'15(1978), 182.</ref>\n\n==Classical art==\n[[File:NAMABG-Aphaia Athena statue.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Restoration of the [[polychrome]] decoration of the Athena statue from the [[Aphaea]] temple at [[Aegina]], c.&nbsp;490 BC (from the exposition ?Bunte G?tter? by the Munich [[Glyptothek]])]]\n[[File:Mosaique Athena Gorgone Museo Pio-Clementino.jpg|thumb|Classical Mosaic from a villa at [[Tusculum]], now at [[Museo Pio-Clementino]], Vatican]]\n[[Image:StonePaletteMythologicalScene.jpg|thumb|Mythological scene with Athena (left) and [[Herakles]] (right), on a [[stone palette]] of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], [[India]]]]\n\nClassically, Athena is portrayed wearing a full-length [[chiton (costume)|chiton]], and sometimes in armor, with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in [[Phidias]]\'s famous lost [[Chryselephantine|gold and ivory]] statue of her, 36 m tall, the \'\'[[Athena Parthenos]]\'\' in the [[Parthenon]]. Athena also often is depicted with an [[owl]] sitting on one of her shoulders.<ref>The owl\'s role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with Athena.</ref>\n\nThe \'\'[[Mourning Athena]]\'\' is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a weary Athena resting on a staff.<!--better interpretation?-->\nIn earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in [[Black-figure pottery]], the goddess retains some of her Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of [[Aphaean Athena]], where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous?\'\'[[Aphaea]]\'\'?goddess with Cretan connections in her \'\'mythos\'\'.\n\nOther commonly received and repeated types of Athena in sculpture may be found in [[:Category:Athena types|this list]].\n\nApart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long. The net result is a serene, serious, somewhat aloof, and very classical beauty.\n\n==Post-classical culture==\n[[File:Chariot clock Telemachus.jpg|thumb|An Empre style [[chariot clock]] with the goddess and Telemachus. France, c. 1810.]] \nA brief summary of Athena\'s evolution of myriad motifs after her dominance in Greece may be seen as follows: The rise of Christianity in Greece largely ended the worship of Greek deities and polytheism in general, but she resurfaced in the Middle Ages as a defender of sagacity and virtue so that her warrior status was still intact. (She may be found on some family crests of nobility.) During the Renaissance she donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor and finally although not ultimately, Athena personified the miracles of freedom and republic during the French Revolution. (A statue of the goddess was centered on the Place de la Revolution in Paris.)<ref name=\"Deacy, Susan 2001\"/>\n\nFor over a century [[Parthenon (Nashville)|a full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which is known as \'\'the Athens of the South\'\'.

Her image can be found in the shields of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], where her owl is the symbol of the Faculty of Chemistry.  Her helmet appears upon the shield of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. At [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college\'s numerous other traditions. Athena\'s owl also serves as the mascot of the college, and one of the college hymns is \"Pallas Athena\".

The statue was placed in the square fronted by the cathedral. Renan\'s head was turned away from the building, while Athena, beside him, was depicted raising her arm, which was interpreted as indicating a challenge to the church during an anti-clerical phase in French official culture. The installation was accompanied by a mass protest from local Roman Catholics and a religious service against the growth of [[skepticism]] and [[secularism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanboucher.net/?d=monuments&p=monuments |title=Musee Virtuel Jean Boucher |publisher=Jeanboucher.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>\n\nAthena has been used numerous times as a symbol of a republic by different countries and appears on currency as she did on the ancient [[drachma]] of Athens.\nAthena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific [[commemorative coin]].

Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice ? for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which [[Merlin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Merlin]] says is impossible; and players\' [[psychic]] abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.\n\n[[Image:Shadow Knight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of \'\'Shadow Knight\'\']]\nA 256-page companion volume, \'\'Shadow Knight\'\',<ref name=\"shadowknight\">Erick Wujcik \'\'Shadow Knight\'\' (Phage Press, 1993) ISBN 1-880494-01-9</ref> was published in 1993.

The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series\' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] but as an example of a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|roleplaying campaign]] with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs. The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books.

The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, \'\'[[The Courts of Chaos]]\'\', but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny\'s cosmology that were featured there in more detail. The \'\'Amber\'\' multiverse consists of \'\'\'Amber\'\'\', a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found [[The Pattern (The Chronicles of Amber)|the Pattern]], the symbol of [[:wikt:order|Order]]; The \'\'\'Courts of Chaos\'\'\', an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found [[the Logrus]], the manifestation of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], and the Abyss, the source or end of all reality; and \'\'\'Shadow\'\'\', the collection of all possible [[universe]]s (shadows) between and around them. Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.\n\nIt is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books ? the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites ? or a resident of the Courts. However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon\'s death \'\'before\'\' the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites. The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an \"[[Amethyst]]\" game. A third option is to have the players portray [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]]\'s children, in an Amber-like city built around Corwin\'s pattern; this is sometimes called an \"[[Argent]]\" game, since one of Corwin\'s [[Heraldry|heraldic]] colours is [[Silver]].\n\n==System==\n\n===Attributes===\nCharacters in \'\'Amber DRPG\'\' are represented by four [[attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]]: \'\'Psyche\'\', \'\'Strength\'\', \'\'Endurance\'\' and \'\'Warfare\'\'.\n*\'\'\'Psyche\'\'\' is used for feats of willpower or magic\n*\'\'\'Strength\'\'\' is used for feats of strength or [[Hand to hand combat|unarmed combat]]\n*\'\'\'Endurance\'\'\' is used for feats of endurance\n*\'\'\'Warfare\'\'\' is used for armed combat, from duelling to commanding armies\nThe attributes run from ?25 (normal human level), through ?10 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit. Scores above 0 are \"ranked\", with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on. The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered \"superior\" in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small.  All else being equal, a character with a higher rank in an attribute will always win a contest based on that attribute.\n\n====The Attribute Auction====\nA character\'s ability scores are purchased during [[character creation]] in an [[auction]]; players get 100 [[character point]]s, and bid on each attribute in turn. The character who bids the most for an attribute is \"ranked\" first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is \"superior\" to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. Instead, lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid, the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.\n\nThe Auction simulates a \'history\' of competition between the descendants of Oberon for [[player character]]s who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings. The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice, cards, or other randomizing devices. A player may intend, for example, to create a character who is a strong, mighty warrior, but being \"outplayed\" in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated, therefore necessitating a change of character concept. Since a player cannot control another player\'s bids, and since all bids are non-refundable, the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players. A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking, but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects. In a hotly contested auction, such as for the important attribute of warfare, the most valuable skill is the ability to force one\'s opponents to back down. With two or more equally determined players, this can result in a \"bidding war\" where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums. An alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid. Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses. A high enough opening bid could signal a player\'s determination to be first ranked in that attribute, thereby dissuading others from competing.\n\n====Psyche in \'\'Amber DRPG\'\' compared to the \'\'Chronicles\'\'====\nCharacters with high psyche are presented as having strong [[telepathic]] abilities, being able to [[hypnotise]] and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact. This is likely due to three scenes in the \'\'Chronicles\'\': first, when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trump and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated; second, when [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]] faces the demon Strygalldwir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and third, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos.<ref name=\"greatbookofamber\">Roger Zelazny \'\'The Great Book of Amber\'\' ([[Eos Press]], 1999) ISBN 0-380-80906-0</ref> However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power; the combination of Brand\'s \"living trump\" powers and his high Psyche (as presented in the roleplaying game) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin. \'\'Shadow Knight\'\' does address this inconsistency somewhat, by presenting the \"living trump\" abilities as somewhat limited.\n\n===Powers===\nCharacters in \'\'Amber DRPG\'\' have access to the powers seen in the \'\'Chronicles of Amber\'\': \'\'Pattern\'\', \'\'Logrus\'\', \'\'Shape-shifting\'\', \'\'Trump\'\', and \'\'magic\'\'.\n\n*\'\'\'Pattern:\'\'\' A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability.\n\n*\'\'\'Logrus:\'\'\' A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themselves or objects through shadow.\n\n*\'\'\'Shape-shifting:\'\'\' Shape-shifters can alter their physical form and abilities.\n\n*\'\'\'Trump:\'\'\' Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of [[tarot]] card which allows mental communication and travel. The book features Trump portraits of each of the elder Amberites. The trump picture of Corwin is executed in a subtly different style ? and has features very similar to Roger Zelazny\'s.\n\n*\'\'\'Magic:\'\'\' Three types of magic are detailed: \'\'\'Power Words\'\'\', with a quick, small effect; \'\'\'Sorcery\'\'\', with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and \'\'\'Conjuration\'\'\', the creation of small objects.\n\nEach of the first four powers is available in an advanced form.\n\n===Artifacts, Personal shadows and Constructs===\nWhile a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues ? unbreakability, or a mind of their own. Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character\'s legend, and cannot lightly be destroyed. Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) \"real\" and therefore useful. The expansion, \'\'Shadow Knight\'\', adds Constructs ? artifacts with connections to shadows.\n\n===Stuff===\nUnspent character points become \'\'\'good stuff\'\'\' ? a good luck for the character. Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming \'\'\'bad stuff\'\'\' ? bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character. Stuff governs how non-player characters perceive and respond to the character: characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions, while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility.\n\nAs well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character\'s [[alignment (role-playing games)|outlook on the universe]]: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.\n\n===Conflict resolution===\nIn any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win. The key words here are \'\'fair\'\' and \'\'eventually\'\' ? if characters\' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters\' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character\'s mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters\' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.\n\n===The \'Golden Rule\'===\n\'\'Amber DRPG\'\' advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit ? even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.\n\n==Community==\nDespite the game\'s [[out-of-print]] status, a thriving [[fan convention|convention]] scene exists supporting the game. Amber conventions, known as \'\'Ambercons\'\', are held yearly in [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] (United States), [[Milton Keynes]] (England) and [[Modena, Italy]]. Additionally, Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated \'\'Amber DRPG\'\' magazine called \'\'Amberzine\'\'.

Alloys are defined by metallic bonding character.<ref>[Callister, W. D. \"Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction\" 2007, 7th edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, Section 4.3 and Chapter 9].</ref> An alloy may be a [[solid solution]] of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions). [[Intermetallic]] compounds are alloys with a defined [[stoichiometry]] and crystal structure. [[Zintl phase]]s are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types (see also: [[Van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle]] for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds).\n\nAlloys are used in a wide variety of applications. In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength. Examples of alloys are [[steel]], [[solder]], [[brass]], [[pewter]], [[duralumin]], [[phosphor bronze]] and [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s.\n\nThe alloy constituents are usually measured by mass. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or [[interstitial alloy]]s, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or [[intermetallic]].\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Born bronze - Bronze casts.jpg|thumb|Liquid [[bronze]], being poured into molds during casting.]]\n[[File:A brass light.JPG|thumb|A [[brass]] lamp.]]\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of either pure or fairly pure [[chemical elements]], which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a [[metal]]. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal, such as [[wrought iron]], in that, with an alloy, the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements; at least one of which being a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be [[solubility|soluble]], dissolving into the mixture.\n\nWhen the alloy cools and solidifies ([[crystallize]]s), its mechanical properties will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft and [[malleability|malleable]], such as [[aluminium]], can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, like [[copper]]. Although both metals are very soft and [[ductility|ductile]], the resulting [[aluminium alloy]] will be much [[hardness|harder]] and [[strength of materials|stronger]]. Adding a small amount of non-metallic [[carbon]] to [[iron]] produces an alloy called [[steel]]. Due to its very-high strength and [[toughness]] (which is much higher than pure iron), and its ability to be greatly altered by [[heat treatment]], steel is one of the most common alloys in modern use. By adding [[chromium]] to steel, its resistance to [[corrosion]] can be enhanced, creating [[stainless steel]], while adding [[silicon]] will alter its electrical characteristics, producing [[silicon steel]].\n\nAlthough the elements usually must be soluble in the [[liquid]] state, they may not always be soluble in the [[solid]] state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a [[solid solution]], becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a [[phase (matter)|phase]]. If the mixture cools and the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous [[microstructure]] of different phases. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. These alloys are called intermetallic alloys because, if cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys separate within the crystals, forming intermetallic phases that serve to reinforce the crystals internally.\n\nSome alloys occur naturally, such as [[electrum]], which is an alloy that is [[native metal|native]] to Earth, consisting of [[silver]] and [[gold]]. Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and [[nickel]], but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was [[bronze]], which is made by mixing the metals [[tin]] and [[copper]]. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires ([[smelting]]) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include [[pewter]], [[brass]] and [[pig iron]]. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. [[Carbon steel]] can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like [[mild steel]] or hard alloys like [[spring steel]]. [[Alloy steel]]s can be made by adding other elements, such as [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]] or nickel, resulting in alloys such as [[high-speed steel]] or [[tool steel]]. Small amounts of [[manganese]] are usually alloyed with most modern-steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]], which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most alloys were not created until the 1900s, such as various aluminium, [[titanium alloy|titanium]], [[nickel alloys|nickel]], and [[magnesium alloy]]s. Some modern [[superalloy]]s, such as [[incoloy]], [[inconel]], and [[hastelloy]], may consist of a multitude of different components.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Inconel gate valve--The-Alloy-Valve-Stockist.JPG|thumb|A gate valve, made from [[Inconel]].]]\n\nThe term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the \'\'base\'\', the \'\'matrix\'\', or the \'\'[[solvent]]\'\'. The secondary constituents are often called \'\'solutes\'\'. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms, not counting impurities, such as a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, then it is called a \'\'binary alloy.\'\' If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a \'\'ternary alloy.\'\' An alloy with four constituents is a \'\'quaternary alloy,\'\' while a five-part alloy is termed a \'\'quinary alloy.\'\' Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a \'\'system\'\'. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a \'\'binary system,\'\' while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a \'\'ternary system\'\'.<ref>Bauccio, Michael (1003) \'\'ASM metals reference book\'\'. ASM International. ISBN 0-87170-478-1.</ref>\n\nAlthough an alloy is technically an impure metal, when referring to alloys, the term \"impurities\" usually denotes those elements which are not desired. These impurities are often found in the base metals or the solutes, but they may also be introduced during the alloying process. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form [[iron sulfide]], which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Verhoeven, John D. |title=Steel Metallurgy for the Non-metallurgist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-1-61503-056-9|page=56}}</ref> [[Lithium]], [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the [[structural integrity]] of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called \"impure metals\" and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form [[metal oxide]]s; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using [[flux (metallurgy)|fluxes]], chemical additives, or other methods of [[extractive metallurgy]].<ref>Davis, Joseph R. (1993) \'\'ASM Specialty Handbook: Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys\'\'. ASM International. p. 211. ISBN 978-0-87170-496-2.</ref>\n\nIn practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 [[Karat (purity)|karat]] [[gold]] is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the [[silver]] used in [[jewelry]] and the [[aluminium]] used as a structural building material are also alloys.\n\nThe term \"alloy\" is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an [[aluminium alloy]] are commonly referred to as simply \"[[alloy wheel]]s\", although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys. Steel is such a common alloy that many items made from it, like [[wheel]]s, [[barrel]]s, or [[girder]]s, are simply referred to by the name of the item, assuming it is made of steel. When made from other materials, they are typically specified as such, (i.e.: \"bronze wheel,\" \"plastic barrel,\" or \"wood girder\").\n\n==Theory==\nAlloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non-metals that often enhance its properties. For example, [[steel]] is stronger than [[iron]], its primary element. The [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as [[density]], [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], [[Young\'s modulus]] of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as [[tensile strength]]<ref>Mills, Adelbert Phillo (1922) \'\'Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties\'\', John Wiley & sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison</ref> and [[shear strength]] may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the [[atom]]s in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=C.|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|journal=Physical Review|volume=188|issue=2|pages=870|year=1969|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|bibcode=1969PhRv..188..870H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=X.|last2=Suhl|first2=H.|title=Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping|journal=Physical Review A|volume=32|pages=2530?2533|year=1985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530|pmid=9896377|issue=4|bibcode=1985PhRvA..32.2530Z}}</ref>\nSome alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. [[Bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]], was the first alloy discovered, during the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period now known as the [[bronze age]]; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]], [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[statue]]s, and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. [[Brass]] is an alloy made from [[copper]] and [[zinc]].\n\nUnlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single [[melting point]], but a melting range in which the material is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] phases. The temperature at which melting begins is called the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]], and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the [[liquidus]]. However, for many alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents (in some cases more than one)?either a [[eutectic]] mixture or a [[Eutectic system#Peritectic|peritectic composition]]?which gives the alloy a unique melting point.\n\n==Heat-treatable alloys==\n[[File:IronAlfa&IronGamma.svg|thumb|left|[[Allotropes of iron]], ([[alpha iron]] and [[gamma iron]]) showing the differences in atomic arrangement.]]\n[[File:Photomicrograph of annealed and quenched steel, from 1911 Britannica plates 11 and 14.jpg|thumb|Photomicrographs of [[steel]].

Bottom photo: [[Quenched]] (quickly cooled) steel forms a single phase called [[martensite]], in which the carbon remains trapped within the crystals, creating internal stresses.]]\n\nAlloys are often made to alter the mechanical properties of the base metal, to induce [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[ductility]], or other desired properties. Most metals and alloys can be [[work hardening|work hardened]] by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during [[plastic deformation]], such as hammering or bending, and are permanent unless the metal is [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallized]]. However, some alloys can also have their properties altered by [[heat treatment]]. Nearly all metals can be softened by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], and [[nickel]] can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree that [[steel]] does.<ref name=\"Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14\"/>\n\nAt a certain temperature, (usually between {{convert|1500|F|C}} and {{convert|1600|F|C}}, depending on carbon content), the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called [[allotropy]]. This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal, [[diffusion|diffusing]] into the iron matrix. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in \'\'[[solid solution|solution]],\'\' or mixed with the iron, forming a single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called [[austenite]]. If the steel is cooled slowly, the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope. When this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be [[solubility|soluble]] with the iron, and will be forced to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, [[nucleating]] into the spaces between the crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, being formed of two phases; the carbon ([[carbide]]) phase [[cementite]], and [[ferrite (iron)|ferrite]]. This type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable. However, if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate. When rapidly cooled, a [[diffusionless transformation|diffusionless (martensite) transformation]] occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, making it very hard and brittle.\n\nConversely, most heat-treatable alloys are [[precipitation hardening]] alloys, which produce the opposite effects that steel does. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, and then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming [[intermetallics|intermetallic]] phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases, precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneous, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.<ref name=\"Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14\"/>\n\n==Substitutional and interstitial alloys==\n[[File:Alloy atomic arrangements showing the different types.jpg|thumb|Different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation, showing pure metal, substitutional, interstitial, and a combination of the two.]]\nWhen a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called \'\'atom exchange\'\' and the \'\'interstitial mechanism\'\'. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a \'\'substitutional alloy\'\'. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the \'\'interstices\'\'. This is referred to as an \'\'interstitial alloy\'\'. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. [[Stainless steel]] is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms.<ref name=\"Jon L.

Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to [[smelting|smelt]] metals such as copper and [[tin]] from [[ore]], and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form [[bronze]], which is much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with [[zinc]] to form [[brass]].<ref>[[#Buchwald|Buchwald]], pp. 39?41</ref> Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as [[hardness]], [[toughness]] and [[melting point]], under various conditions of [[temperature]] and [[work hardening]], developing much of the information contained in modern [[Phase diagram|alloy phase diagram]]s.<ref name=r1/> Arrowheads from the Chinese [[Qin dynasty]] (around 200 BC) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head, but a softer bronze-tang, combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/emperors-ghost-army.html Emperor\'s Ghost Army]. pbs.org.

Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called [[gilding]], such as [[armor]] and [[mirror]]s. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind.<ref>Rapp, George (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ed0yC98aAKYC&pg=PA180 \'\'Archaeomineralogy\'\'].

In ancient [[Egypt]] and [[Mycenae]], gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of [[colored gold]]. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to silver to make [[sterling silver]], increasing its strength for use in dishes, silverware, and other practical items. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers.<ref>Nicholson, Paul T. and Shaw, Ian (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7A9jJrZP0C&pg=PA164 \'\'Ancient Egyptian materials and technology\'\'].

As a pure metal, tin was much too soft to be used for any practical purpose. However, in the [[Bronze age]], tin was a rare metal and, in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, was often valued higher than gold. To make jewelry, forks and spoons, or other objects from tin, it was usually alloyed with other metals to increase its strength and hardness. These metals were typically [[lead]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]] or copper. These solutes sometimes were added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of things, ranging from practical items, like dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items such as ear rings and hair clips.\n\nThe earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC. The use of pewter was widespread across Europe, from France to Norway and Britain (where most of the ancient tin was mined) to the Near East.<ref>Hull, Charles (1992) \'\'Pewter\'\'. Shire Publications. pp. 3?4; ISBN 0-7478-0152-5</ref> The alloy was also used in China and the Far East, arriving in Japan around 800 AD, where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels, tea canisters, or chalices used in [[shinto]] shrines.<ref>Brinkley, Frank (1904) \'\'Japan and China: Japan, its history, arts, and literature\'\'. Oxford University. p. 317</ref>\n\n===Steel and pig iron===\nThe first known smelting of iron began in [[Anatolia]], around 1800 BC. Called the [[bloomery|bloomery process]], it produced very soft but [[ductile]] [[wrought iron]]. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. [[Pig iron]], a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and [[carbon]], was being produced in [[History of China#Shang Dynasty (c. 1700?1046 BC)|China]] as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making [[cast-iron]]. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of [[crucible steel]] around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of [[pattern welding]], around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove [[slag]] and impurities. This method of [[Japanese swordsmithing]] produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the early Middle Ages.<ref name=r1>Smith, Cyril (1960) \'\'History of metallography\'\'. MIT Press. pp. 2?4. ISBN 0-262-69120-5.</ref>\n\nWhile the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of [[steel]], (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by [[heat treatment]] had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of [[blister steel]] during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of [[tool steel]]. Huntsman\'s process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\">Roberts, George Adam; Krauss, George; Kennedy, Richard and Kennedy, Richard L.

ISBN 0-87170-599-0.</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, [[pig iron]] was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the [[liquid]] pig iron to create steel. [[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by [[oxidation]]. In 1858, [[Sir Henry Bessemer]] developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The [[Bessemer process]] was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\"/> Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. [[Mangalloy]], an alloy of steel and [[manganese]] exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, was one of the first [[alloy steel]]s, and was created by [[Robert Hadfield]] in 1882.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bramfitt, B.

Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when [[quenching|quenched]] (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and [[magnesium]], Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, [[duralumin]] was one of the first \"age hardening\" alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern [[aircraft]].<ref>Jacobs, M.
